## The Basics

GoatFormat.com has an excellent write-up that covers all of the basics of Goat Format and how it differs from modern Yu-Gi-Oh! Check it out [here](https://www.goatformat.com/basics.html)

### First Turn Draw Phase

*   The player who goes first draws during their draw phase.

### Deck Limit

*   There is no limit to the number of Fusion monsters that can be in your Fusion Deck
*   There is no limit to the numbers of cards you can have in your main deck
*   Side decks must be 0 or 15 cards (This was the ruling during Goat Format but is not commonly enforced. Ruling on this may vary from TO).

### Field Spells

* Only 1 face-up field spell can be active at a time
* If you control a face-up field spell and your opponent were to active a field spell, your field spell would be destroyed on resolution.
* If you control a face-up field spell and your opponent were to set a field spell, your field spell would not be destroyed.
* If you control a face-up field spell and your opponent were to activate a field spell, you can save your field spell from being destroyed by chaining "Dust Tornado" or "Mystical Space Typhoon" to it's activation. Since the opponent's field spell would be destroyed before it resolves your field spell would not be destroyed.

### Priority - Ignition Effects

    * **WIP**

### Replays
* If the number of monsters your opponent controls changes during your battle step it will cause a replay. You may decide to re-declare your attack with a different monster or the same monster. Even if you choose to attack with a different monster you can still attack with the original monster. Below is an example to help explain.
* In the example you control two-face-up monsters, "Garnecia Elefantis" and "Asura Priest". Your opponent has no monsters on the field and 1 card set in their Spell & Trap Zone. You declare a direct attack with "Garnecia Elefantis". Your opponent responds by activating "Scapegoat". The numbers of monsters on their side of the field has changed this will cause a replay to occur. At this point you can you decide to re-declare the attack with "Garnecia Elefantis" or choose to declare the attack with "Asura Priest". If you choose to declare the attack with "Asura Priest" you can attack all tokens and then declare a direct attack with "Garnecia Elefantis" due to the mechanics of the replay.
 * **Important note regarding the above example** If you would have successfully already attacked directly with "Asura Priest" a replay would not allow you to attack with it again. Same example as above but you choose to attack directly with "Asura Priest" first. Your opponent has no response and you successfully deal 1700 damage to your opponent. You then declare a second direct attack with "Garnecia Elefantis". Your opponent responds by activating "Scapegoat". A replay will still occur but you can not choose to attack with "Asura Priest" due to it already battling this turn.
* When a replay occurs, regardless of whether or not you declare a attack with the original monster or a different monster your opponent cant respond to that attack with a battle trap. It is important to know that a replay causes you re-declare the attack even when attack the same monster with the same monster. It is considered a new attack, not a redirection of the attack.

### Continuous Traps
* Continuous trap that have ignition like effects can NOT be activated during the same chain that the continuous trap card itself is activated.
* If you have a face-down "Royal Oppression" and your opponent activates "Premature Burial", you can chain "Royal Oppression" to it, but can not chain the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate. To have negated "Premature Burial", "Royal Oppression" would have needed to be already be face-up on the field.

### Verification of Hand and Deck

### Fail to Find
* You can activate cards that search the deck even if there are no legal options in the deck.
* "Thunder Dragon" can be discarded to grave for the search effect even if there are no more copies of "Thunder Dragon" left in the deck.
* "Toon Table of Contents" can be activated even if there are no "Toon" cards in deck.

### Unions
* A monster can only have union monster equipped to it at a time.
* Attached union monsters can  usually be used to prevent destruction from combat but not destruction from card effects.

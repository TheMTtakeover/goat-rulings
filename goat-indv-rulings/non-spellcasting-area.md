#### NON-SPELLCASTING AREA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, you cannot use face-up monsters on the field, except Effect Monsters, for "Polymerization" or Ritual Spell Cards.
*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, no Spell Card, including "Raigeki" or Equip Spell Cards, can affect a monster, unless it is an Effect Monster.
*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, and only one player has Effect Monsters on the field, you can activate “Creature Swap” but its effect will be negated because none of the non-Effect Monsters can switch control due to a Spell Card’s effect.
*   The effect of “Non-Spellcasting Area” includes Ritual Monsters and Fusion Monsters that do not have effects, as well as Monster Tokens.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Non-Effect monsters may be targeted by Spell Cards while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active.
*   Tokens are considered Non-Effect monsters and are protected by the effect of “Non-Spellcasting Area.”
*   If “Change of Heart” is played on a face down non-Effect Monster and flipped face up while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is in effect, the non-Effect Monster will immediately return to its original controller.
*   If one player’s field has only face up non-Effect monsters when “Creature Swap” resolves while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is in effect, “Creature Swap’s” effect disappears.
*   If a non-Effect monster has been Special Summoned by “Premature Burial” and “Premature Burial” is destroyed while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, the monster Special Summoned by “Premature Burial” will remain on the field.

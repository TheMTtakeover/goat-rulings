#### APPRENTICE MAGICIAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you Special Summon "Apprentice Magician" face-down (such as with "Apprentice Magician"'s effect) then you do not place a Spell Counter.
*   You get to Special Summon a new monster when "Apprentice Magician" is destroyed as a result of battle, even if "Banisher of the Light" is in play.
*   Because "Apprentice Magician"'s effect is not a Graveyard effect, the controller of "Apprentice Magician" at the time it is destroyed as a result of battle gets its effect. So if I take control of my opponent's "Apprentice Magician", and it is destroyed as a result of battle, then I Special Summon, not the original owner.
*   You must show your opponent the monster you Special Summon.
*   For effects that place a Spell Counter, you can chain to the activation of those effects. The Spell Counter is actually placed when the effect resolves.

Judge List Rulings:

*   If your "Apprentice Magician" is destroyed by battle while you control four other monsters, its effect will disappear because you do not have an available Monster Zone space. Curtis Schultz, 04/20/2005
*   Other Rulings:
*   An active "Skill Drain" can negate the effects of the "D.D. Warrior Lady," "D.D. Assailant," and "Apprentice Magician." But "The End of Anubis" has no effect on them, because they are on the field when their effects activate AND they do not target any card(s) in the Graveyard. Curtis Schultz, 05/01/2005

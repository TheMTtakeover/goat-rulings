#### MAGICAL MARIONETTE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   There is no limit to the number of Spell Counters you can have on "Magical Marionette".
*   Removing Spell Counters from "Magical Marionette" to use its effect is a cost.
*   You can use "Magical Marionette"'s effect multiple times in the same turn, as long as you have enough Spell Counters to pay the cost.
*   You can destroy "Magical Marionette" with its own effect.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Magical Marionette", "Magical Marionette" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Magical Marionette" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Magical Marionette” constantly checks the number of Spell Counters on it for the purposes of calculating ATK.

#### ARSENAL BUG

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 2 "Arsenal Bugs" on your side of the field, each has ATK 2000.
*   If the ATK of "Arsenal Bug" is 1000, and it is equipped with an Equip Spell Card or modified by a Field Spell Card, recalculate. So begin with the 1000 ATK, then increase or decrease from there according to other card effects.
*   When "Arsenal Bug" is Summoned and there are no other Insect-Type monsters on your side of the field, your opponent cannot activate "Bottomless Trap Hole" because the ATK of "Arsenal Bug" is 1000 when it is Summoned.
*   If the only other Insect-Type monster on your side of the field is face-down, the ATK of "Arsenal Bug" is 1000.
*   If you equip "Megamorph" to "Arsenal Bug" then its ATK will be 4000 or 1000, depending on "Megamorph"â€™s effect.

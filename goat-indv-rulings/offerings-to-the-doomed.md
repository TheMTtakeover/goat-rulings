#### OFFERINGS TO THE DOOMED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Skipping your next Draw Phase is not a cost, so if your opponent chains "Magic Jammer" or "Imperial Order" to negate this card, you do NOT skip your next Draw Phase.
*   If your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to flip the target of this card face-down, the monster is not destroyed and you will skip your next Draw Phase.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If the activation of “Offerings to the Doomed” is negated, that player does not skip his or her Draw Phase.
*   If multiple “Offerings to the Doomed” are activated in the same Turn, the activating Player will skip only one Draw Phase.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If I use “Offerings to the Doomed” on a face-up “Spirit Reaper,” do I still have to skip my next Draw Phase?  
    A: “Spirit Reaper” will be destroyed by “Offerings to the Doomed” and you must skip your next Draw Phase. bishop, 12/23/2003

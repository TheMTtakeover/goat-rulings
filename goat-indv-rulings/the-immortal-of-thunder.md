#### THE IMMORTAL OF THUNDER

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Dark Ruler Ha Des” destroys “The Immortal of Thunder,” the effect of “The Immortal of Thunder” is negated.
*   If “The Immortal of Thunder’s” Life Gain effect has successfully resolved, the later presence of “Skill Drain” will not prevent the loss of Life Points by the effect of “The Immortal of Thunder” being sent to the Graveyard.

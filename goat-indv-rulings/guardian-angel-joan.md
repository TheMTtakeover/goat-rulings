#### GUARDIAN ANGEL JOAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The controller (not the owner) of "Guardian Angel Joan" increases his/her Life Points.
*   When "Guardian Angel Joan" is destroyed while battling a monster with equal ATK (such as another "Guardian Angel Joan"), her effect is NOT activated because "Guardian Angel Joan" has been removed from the field.
*   When "Guardian Angel Joan" attacks "Cyber Jar", "Guardian Angel Joan"'s effect is not activated because she is destroyed before "Cyber Jar" is sent to the Graveyard.
*   Netrep Rulings:
*   In determining the increase in Life Points for the effect of “Guardian Angel Joan”, the original ATK is the number printed on the card.
*   The original ATK of “Maju Garzett”, “Great Maju Garzett” and “Gren Maju Da Eiza”, when destroyed by “Guardian Angel Joan” is treated as zero.

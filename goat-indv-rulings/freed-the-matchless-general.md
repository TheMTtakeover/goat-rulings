#### FREED THE MATCHLESS GENERAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card’s effect that negates Spell Cards that target it is not optional.
*   You can Special Summon this card from the Graveyard with "Monster Reborn" because its effect that negates Spell Cards is not active while it is in the Graveyard.
*   You can activate "Premature Burial" to Special Summon this card from the Graveyard, and then this card’s effect will negate and destroy "Premature Burial". "Freed the Matchless General" will not be destroyed since the effect of "Premature Burial" was negated by his effect.
*   If this card is targeted by the effect of a Spell Card while face-down, the Spell Card’s effect resolves.
*   If your opponent activates "Change of Heart" and gains control of this card while it is face-down, and it is then flipped face-up, they retain control of it until the end of the turn. This is because the effect of "Freed the Matchless General" must be applied when the Spell Card is activated.
*   A Spell Card that targets this card may be activated, but it will be negated and destroyed.
*   The effect of this card will not negate "Creature Swap", "Fissure", "Smashing Ground", "Dark Hole", "Raigeki", or similar Spell Cards that do not target.
*   If you try to equip "Fusion Sword Murasame Blade" to this monster, it will be negated and destroyed.
*   The effect of this card that allows you to forfeit your draw to place a Warrior-Type monster from your Deck into your hand is optional. You do not have to activate it if you don’t want to. If you attempt to activate this effect and find that you do not have any Warrior-Type monsters in your Deck, you do not get your normal draw back. You have already forfeited it.
*   You can only forfeit your normal draw. If you activate "Jar of Greed" during the Draw Phase, you cannot replace that draw with the effect of "Freed the Matchless General".
*   If you have two copies of this card on the field, you can still only add 1 Warrior-Type monster to your hand by forfeiting your normal draw.
*   The activation of this card’s effect that adds a Warrior-Type monster to your hand can be chained to.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If the Draw Phase is skipped, “Freed the Matchless General’s” Warrior-Type searching effect, is also skipped.
*   If “Freed the Matchless General” is face-up and active on the field when “Maharaghi’s” effect would resolve, resolve the effect of “Freed the Matchless General” first.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: How does “Freed the Matchless General” resolve in regards to “Butterfly Dagger – Elma’ and “Blast with Chain”?  
    A: “Freed the Matchless General’s” effect is like a built-in “Riryoku Field”. If the “Butterfly Dagger – Elma” specficially designates “Freed the Matchless General” it will be negated and destroyed by “Freed the Matchless General's” effect. It would not return to the owner's hand. “Blast with Chain” is considered a Trap Card when it chooses its target, so it can be equipped to “Freed the Matchless General.” He will not negate or destroy “Blast with Chain” when its resolves.

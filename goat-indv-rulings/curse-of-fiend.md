#### CURSE OF FIEND

Netrep Rulings:

*   Face-down Defense position monsters will be changed to face-up Attack position by the effect of “Curse of Fiend.” Any applicable Flip Effects will activate at that time.
*   Monsters affected by “Curse of Fiend” may have their battle positions changed by effects.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Curse of Fiend’s” effect work on Set monsters and would it be considered a Flip Summon?  
    A: A Set monster would be changed to face-up attack position. It would not be considered Flip-Summoned, because its position was changed by a card effect, but its Flip-Effect would activate if it had one. Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004

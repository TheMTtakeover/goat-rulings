#### CARD OF SAFE RETURN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your opponent uses "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon a monster from your Graveyard, you get to draw a card.
*   If the Special Summon is negated with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment" you do not get to draw a card.
*   Drawing a card for this card’s effect is optional, so if you use "Call of the Haunted" when you have no cards left in your Deck you do not lose the Duel.

Netrep Rulings:

*   A player with multiple “Card of Safe Returns” active on the field may draw 1 card for each “Card of Safe Return” when a monster is Special Summoned from that player’s Graveyard.
*   If a monster is Special Summoned from the Graveyard of a player with a “Card of Safe Return” by the opponent, the player with the “Card of Safe Return” may draw 1 card.

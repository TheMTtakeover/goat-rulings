#### CHAOS SORCERER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only activate "Chaos Sorcerer"'s effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.
*   You can only activate "Chaos Sorcerer"'s effect once in a turn.
*   If "Chaos Sorcerer" attacks, you cannot use its effect during Main Phase 2. But if "Chaos Sorcerer" did not attack, you can activate its effect in Main Phase 2.
*   If you select a face-up monster with "Chaos Sorcerer"'s effect, and your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to flip the monster face-down, then "Chaos Sorcerer"'s effect disappears. But even if "Chaos Sorcerer"'s effect disappears, its effect was activated so it cannot attack or activate its effect again.
*   If "Chaos Sorcerer" attacks and the attack is negated with "Magic Cylinder", "Chaos Sorcerer" cannot activate its effect in Main Phase 2.
*   If "Chaos Sorcerer" attacks and a replay occurs, and you decide not to attack again with "Chaos Sorcerer", you cannot activate "Chaos Sorcerer"'s effect in Main Phase 2.

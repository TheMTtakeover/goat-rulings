#### TRIBUTE DOLL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot use "Tribute Doll" to Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster like "Dark Necrofear".
*   You can use Monster Tokens as a cost for "Tribute Doll".
*   If you Special Summon a monster with "Tribute Doll", you cannot activate "Diffusion Wave-Motion" on that monster because it cannot attack that turn due to "Tribute Doll"'s effect. However, you can use "Diffusion Wave-Motion" on the monster during your next turn.
*   You can combine "Soul Exchange" with "Tribute Doll" to Tribute your opponent's monster as the cost of "Tribute Doll".

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Tribute Doll” is not a targeting effect.
*   If the monster Special Summoned by “Tribute Doll” is sent to the Graveyard and Special Summoned in the same turn, that monster may attack.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If Player A takes control of Player B’s monster with “Change of Heart” and activates “Tribute Doll” which Player B chains “Imperial Order” to, what happens to Player B’s monster?  
    A: Player B's monster would be Tributed when you activate "Tribute Doll." This is assuming Player B allowed the "Change of Heart" to resolve, which it sounds like they did. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004

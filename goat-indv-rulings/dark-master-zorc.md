#### DARK MASTER - ZORC

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you roll a 6, "Dark Master - Zorc" is also destroyed.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: When is the target for “Dark Master – Zorc” chosen and will the effect be considered targeting if the dice roll is 3, 4, or 5?  
    A: You would have to choose your target during resolution. When you activate the effect of "Dark Master - Zorc," you have no idea what is going to happen. Due to this, the effect cannot declare any target at activation. Curtis Schultz, 02/15/2004

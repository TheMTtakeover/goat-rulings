#### FORCED REQUISITION

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Forced Requisition” may only be activated immediately after an instance of discarding where the final action of the chain is a discard.
*   “Forced Requisition” may not be activated in response to a discard as a result of a cost.
*   “Forced Requisition” may not be activated in the Damage Step.
*   "Forced Requisition" may be activated when a player must discard because of having more than 6 cards during the End Phase.
*   If "Forced Requisition" is already active when "Card Destruction" resolves, the opponent of the controller of "Forced Requisition" must discard an equal number of cards as the controller of "Forced Requisition" discarded for the effect of "Card Destruction" after "Card Destruction" resolves.
*   If an active “Jinzo” is destroyed by an effect that has a cost of discarding a card (such as through “Tribute to the Doomed”) while “Forced Requisition” is active, the opponent does not discard a card through “Forced Requisition’s” effect as “Jinzo” was active when the discard occurred.
*   If "Forced Requisition" is already active when the controller activates "Magic Jammer", the opponent of the controller of "Forced Requisition" discards one card immediately after the Activation of "Magic Jammer".

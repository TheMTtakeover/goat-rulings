#### THESTALOS THE FIRESTORM MONARCH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you Tribute Summon "Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch" successfully, and your opponent discards a monster like "Outstanding Dog Marron" or "Regenerating Mummy", you still inflict damage because the monster was discarded to the Graveyard (even though it doesn’t remain there).
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is face-up on the field, no damage is inflicted because the card is not discarded to the Graveyard.

*   If “Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch” is tribute summoned using “Sangan”, “Sangan” will be CL1 and Thestalos will be CL2. This is true even if the “Sangan” that was used as a tribute was the opponent’s through the effect of “Brain Control”, “Soul Exchange”, etc.

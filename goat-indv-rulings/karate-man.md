Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Would “Messenger of Peace” effectively stop “Karate Man” from using his effect?  
    A: “Karate Man's” effect is Spell Speed 1, and it can only be activated during one of your own Main Phases. Since “Karate Man's” ATK would be over 1500 before you declare the attack, you definitely cannot attack after using “Karate Man's” effect if “Messenger of Peace” is on the field. Similarly, as “Karate Man” is a Spell Speed 1 effect, it cannot be used during the opponent's turn at all. So, if a “Gemini Elf” (for example) attacks your “Karate Man,” you don't get to use the effect and “Karate Man” is destroyed from battle. Steve Okegawa, 01/07/2004

#### ARCHFIEND OF GILFER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Missing the Timing: “Archfiend of Gilfer” is a “when… you can” optional Trigger Effect. This means that “Archfiend of Gilfer” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order to activate its effect.
*   This card's effect will activate when it is sent to the Graveyard from the field, hand, or Deck. This card's effect will activate when it is sent to the Graveyard while it is a Monster Card or an Equip Card.
*   If multiple "Archfiend of Gilfer" cards are sent to the Graveyard at the same time, all their effects will activate and form a chain.

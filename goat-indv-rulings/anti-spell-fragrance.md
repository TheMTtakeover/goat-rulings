#### ANTI-SPELL FRAGRANCE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The "use" in this card's text means "activate". So you may discard Spell Cards from your hand for the cost of other cards.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Anti-Spell Fragrance” is activated in a chain to a Spell Card, that Spell Card will resolve properly. “Anti-Spell Fragrance” only applies to the activation of Spell Cards after the chain it is activated in resolves.
*   Field Spell Cards must be Set for one turn if “Anti-Spell Fragrance” is active.
*   Spell Cards that were Set for one turn before “Anti-Spell Fragrance” was active may be activated.

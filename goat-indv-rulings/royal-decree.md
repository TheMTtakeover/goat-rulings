#### ROYAL DECREE

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Skill Drain” is active on the field when “Jinzo” is summoned, and “Royal Decree” is later activated, “Royal Decree” will negate “Skill Drain”. Since “Skill Drain” is no longer negating “Jinzo’s” effect, “Jinzo” will negate both “Royal Decree” and “Skill Drain.”

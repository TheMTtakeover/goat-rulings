#### GRAVEKEEPER'S SERVANT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 2 of this card on the field, their effects are cumulative.
*   If your opponent has no cards left in his/her Deck, he/she cannot declare an attack while this card is on your side of the field.
*   Netrep Rulings:
*   While “Gravekeeper’s Servant” is active, discarding a card from the top of the Deck becomes a cost to declare an attack.
*   If a player does not have sufficient cards remaining in his/her Deck to fulfill the requirements of “Gravekeeper’s Servant,” that player may not attack.
*   If the opponent has more than one “Gravekeeper’s Servant” active on his or her field, the player must discard 1 card for each “Gravekeeper’s Servant” when he or she declares an attack.
*   The card sent from the top of the deck to the Graveyard is sent even if the attack is negated if “Gravekeeper’s Servant” is active on the field.

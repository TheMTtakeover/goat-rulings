#### LIMITER REMOVAL

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Limiter Removal” doubles the current ATK of the monster it affects.
*   A second “Limiter Removal” will double the effect of the first “Limiter Removal.”
*   If an effect that changes the ATK value of a monster before it was affected by “Limiter Removal” is later removed, the ATK of the affected monster is not changed.
*   If an effect that changes the ATK value of a monster after it has been affected by “Limiter Removal,” the ATK value of that monster will be altered.
*   If the monster affected by “Limiter Removal” is removed from the field or turned face-down, the monster is not destroyed by the effect of “Limiter Removal” at the end of the turn and the ATK value of the affected monster resets.
*   If “DNA Surgery” changes Machine Types to non-Machine-Types after “Limiter Removal” has affected Machine-Types, the monsters affected by “Limiter Removal” will still be destroyed.

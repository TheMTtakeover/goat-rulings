#### PROHIBITION

Netrep Rulings:

*   A card declared by "Prohibition" may not be Normal Set, Normal Summoned, or activated.
*   A card declared by "Prohibition" may be Special Summoned, but will have no effect and may not attack.
*   Monster cards chosen by the effect of "Prohibition" may not be Set.
*   “Prohibition” will not prevent an instant win through the effect of “Exodia the Forbidden One.”
*   If a “Prohibition” that declares “Jinzo” is negated by “Imperial Order”, “Jinzo” may be Summoned.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Prohibition” has been activated and “Spirit Message ‘L’” is selected, will that prevent “Destiny Board” from completing the message?  
    A: “Prohibition” would not stop the “Spirit Message ‘L’” from being placed onto the field by the effect of “Destiny Board.” Curtis Schultz, 04/07/2004
*   Q: Does “Prohibition” only affect the field? (“Kuriboh”/”Thunder Dragon” never reach the field)  
    A: “Prohibition” prevents the named card from being played. Activating the effect of “Thunder Dragon” or “Kuriboh” would be playing it. Curtis Schultz, 04/21/2004
*   Q: If my opponent already has Set the card declared with “Prohibition,” can he activate the card?  
    A: Yes they can. Prohibited cards that were Set on the field before “Prohibition” resolved can still be activated. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004
*   Q: If my opponent plays “Monster Reborn” on the card declared with “Prohibition,” that is not considered “playing it” right?  
    A: Right, but if the Monster Card is an Effect Monster Card, it will have no effect AND the monster would not be able to attack \[or change its battle position\]. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004

#### MANTICORE OF DARKNESS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Manticore of Darkness"' effect can be activated during the End Phase when it was sent to the Graveyard from the field, hand, or your Deck that same turn.
*   When you send 1 "Manticore of Darkness" to the Graveyard to Special Summon another "Manticore of Darkness", you can then send the new "Manticore of Darkness" to the Graveyard to Special Summon the first "Manticore of Darkness".
*   If "Card of Safe Return" is active, and "Manticore of Darkness" is Special Summoned with its effect, you can draw a card. So with 2 "Manticores of Darkness", 1 of them sent to the Graveyard, and "Card of Safe Return" in play, you can draw as many cards as you want.
*   When "Manticore of Darkness" is sent to the Graveyard because of hand size adjustment in the End Phase, you can activate its effect.
*   You can send a face-down Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast-Type monster to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect.
*   Sending monsters to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect is a cost.
*   You can't send a Monster Token to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect because Monster Tokens are taken off the field instead of going to the Graveyard.
*   The owner of "Manticore of Darkness" gets the effect, so if your opponent controls your "Manticore of Darkness" and it's sent to the Graveyard, you get to activate the effect.

#### KIRYU

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Mask of Restrict" is active, you cannot Tribute "Kiryu" because "Mask of Restrict" prevents all Tributing, including Tributing Equip Spell Cards.
*   If you Tribute "Kiryu" while it is equipped to "Dark Blade", you cannot then use "Super Rejuvenation" and count "Kiryu" as a Dragon-Type monster.
*   If you Tribute "Kiryu" while equipped to "Dark Blade", "Dark Blade" no longer gets the ATK increase from "Kiryu" as it is no longer equipped with it.

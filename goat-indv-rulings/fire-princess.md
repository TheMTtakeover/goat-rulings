#### FIRE PRINCESS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 1 "Fire Princess" and 2 "Solemn Wishes" on the field, "Fire Princess"’s effect deals 1000 damage to your opponent when you draw. If you have 1 "Fire Princess" and 2 "Marie the Fallen One" in your Graveyard, "Fire Princess"’s effect deals 1000 damage to your opponent during your Standby Phase.
*   If you have 2 "Fire Princesses" and 1 "Solemn Wishes" on the field, your opponent takes 1000 damage when you draw a card (and takes 2000 damage if you had 2 "Solemn Wishes" on the field instead of 1).
*   If "Mysterious Puppeteer" is on the field when you Summon "Fire Princess", "Fire Princess"’s effect will deal 500 damage to your opponent because of "Mysterious Puppeteer"’s effect.
*   If you have "Soul Absorption" and "Fire Princess" face-up on the field when your opponent removes 3 monsters from his Graveyard to Summon "Dark Necrofear" you will gain 1500 Life Points and "Fire Princess"’s effect will deal 500 Damage to your opponent.
*   If you have a face-up "Fire Princess" and a Set "Poison of the Old Man" when your opponent activates "Dark Hole" you may chain "Poison of the Old Man" to increase your Life Points and the effect of "Fire Princess" will deal 500 damage to your opponent even though she is then destroyed by "Dark Hole", because the effect of "Fire Princess" is a Continuous Effect.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If I use “Fire Princess” with “Gift of the Mystical Elf”, how much damage does “Fire Princess” do? Is it the same with these cards (“Numinous Healer”, “Life Absorbing Machine”, “Emergency Provisions”, and “The Spell Absorbing Life”)?  
    A: Each of the queried cards, individually, increases Life Points in "one shot," so in each case presented, “Fire Princess” will only do 500 damage. bishop, 01/19/2004

#### ASSAULT ON GHQ

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you cannot destroy a monster with this effect, you cannot send cards from your opponent’s Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If you destroy “Peten the Dark Clown”, you miss the timing on its activation because it was not the last effect to resolve, so you cannot Special Summon another “Peten the Dark Clown”.

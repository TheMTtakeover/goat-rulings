#### PANDEMONIUM WATCHBEAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your opponent activates "Huge Revolution" while your "Pandemonium Watchbear" is on your side of the field, your "Pandemonium" will not be destroyed.
*   When your "Pandemonium" is going to be destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon", you can chain "Ceasefire" to flip your "Pandemonium Watchbear" face-up, and "Pandemonium" will not be destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a Field Spell Card is played while “Pandemonium” is active, “Pandemonium” is destroyed, even if “Pandemonium Watchbear” is on the field.

#### APPROPRIATE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Appropriate” may not be activated in the Damage Step.
*   In the event each player has an active “Appropriate”, if one player activates a card that allows him or her to Draw, an infinite Loop is created. If one player has all 5 pieces of Exodia in his or her hand during the resolution of this loop, that player immediately wins. Otherwise, the player who is unable to Draw first loses the duel.
*   If “Appropriate” has already been active when “Graceful Charity” resolves, the effect of “Appropriate” will successfully resolve. If “Appropriate” is not active when “Graceful Charity” resolves, “Appropriate” may not be activated.

If the face-down "Amazoness Tiger" is flipped with "Swords of Revealing Light", etc., the flipped "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed but the original "Amazoness Tiger" is not.
*   If both players control a face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you use "Snatch Steal" on your opponent's "Amazoness Tiger", then that "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed after coming to your side of the field.
*   If both players have a face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you give your opponent your "Amazoness Tiger" with "Creature Swap", then your "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed.

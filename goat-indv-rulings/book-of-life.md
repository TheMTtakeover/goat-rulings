#### BOOK OF LIFE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Book of Life" if there is no monster in the Graveyard to remove from play.
*   You cannot activate "Book of Life" if your opponent controls "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer".
*   If you activate "Book of Life" and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer", you still get to Special Summon 1 Zombie with Book of Life's effect (but do not remove 1 monster from your opponentâ€™s Graveyard).

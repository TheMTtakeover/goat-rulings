#### DIMENSIONHOLE

Netrep Rulings:

*   The monster zone the monster removed by “Dimensionhole” will be considered occupied. Monsters may not be summoned or Special Summoned into this monster zone.
*   Tokens may be removed from play through the effect of “Dimensionhole,” but will not return to play.
*   If the Standby Phase the “Dimensionhole” would return the monster in is skipped, “Dimensionhole’s” effect disappears and the monster remains removed from play.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If an end of turn effect is scheduled for a monster (as in being destroyed) and you use “Dimensionhole,” is it applied when the monster comes back into play?
*   A: It is not destroyed and it is "reset" after it comes back. bishop, 12/05/2003

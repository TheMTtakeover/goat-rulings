#### GILASAURUS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this card only activates when you elect to change its Normal Summon to a Special Summon. Not if it is Special Summoned by "Monster Reborn", "Marauding Captain", etc.
*   You can use the effect of this card to change its Normal Summon to a Special Summon even if your opponent has no monsters in their Graveyard.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Disappear” can be chained to the effect of “Gilasaurus” to remove the monster chosen to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard from play.
*   If “Necrovalley” is active on the field, “Gilasaurus” may still be used as a Special Summon. The opponent may not Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard from “Gilasaurus’” effect as a result of the effect of “Necrovalley.”
*   If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, “Gilasaurus” may still be used as a Special Summon. The opponent may not Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard from “Gilasaurus’” effect as “Gilasaurus” effect is negated by “Skill Drain.”

#### AXE OF DESPAIR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If all your monsters are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously by the effect of "Cyber Jar", "Raigeki", etc. and "Axe of Despair" is equipped to one of them, you cannot Tribute one of those monsters to return "Axe of Despair" to the top of your Deck. You also cannot Tribute one of the monsters Special Summoned by the effect of "Cyber Jar" since the timing has passed.
*   Since "Axe of Despair" activates in the Graveyard, you can Tribute a monster to return it to the top of your Deck even if "Imperial Order" is on the field.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Axe of Despair” is considered an Archfiend, but not an Archfiend monster, for the purpose of “Falling Down.”
*   You may not Tribute your opponent’s monster for the effect of “Axe of Despair.” You may Tribute your monster during your opponent’s turn to satisfy the effect of “Axe of Despair.”

#### COST DOWN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Level of a monster which is Summoned using "Cost Down" is still decreased by 2 after Summoning. The 2 Level reduction lasts until the End Phase.
*   When you Ritual Summon while "Cost Down" is active, the Level Stars that you need is not changed, even if you are using "Contract with the Abyss" or "Earth Chant".
*   You can use multiple "Cost Downs" in the same turn and their effects accumulate, so 3 "Cost Downs" lowers the level by 6 Stars.
*   While "A Legendary Ocean" and 1 "Cost Down" are active, your WATER monsters are reduced by 3 Stars.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Cost Down’s” effect lasts for the duration of the turn “Cost Down” resolved. This includes if the monster is summoned to the field.
*   “Cost Down” allows for the Normal Summon of Level 5 and 6 monsters.
*   If two “Cost Downs” are activated in the same turn, the Star Level of all monsters in the hand will be reduced by 4.
*   “Cost Down” does not reduce the Star requirement for Ritual summons.
*   If “Cost Down” has been activated before a Ritual summon, monsters in the hand are still 2 stars lower for the purpose of fulfi lling the Ritual Summoning requirement.
*   “Cost Down” has no effect on the monsters revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2” as the monsters are never considered in the hand.
*   If “Cost Down” is used before the Summon of “Maju Garzett” or “Great Maju Garzett”, the ATK of both monsters will be 0 as they were not Tribute Summoned with the appropriate number of monsters.
*   If “Cost Down” has been activated in the same Turn before a “Marauding Captain” is Normal Summoned, a Level 5 or 6 monster may be Special Summoned through the effect of “Marauding Captain.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: What would happen if you used “Cost Down,” and then you use “Contract with the Abyss” to summon “Relinquished,” would it still count as a Level 1 monster?  
    A: “Contract with the Abyss” should be written as “This card is used to Ritual Summon any DARK Monster. You must also offer monsters from the field or you hand whose total Level Stars equal the ORIGINAL Level Stars of the Ritual Monster you are attempting to Ritual Summon.” bishop, 12/22/2003
*   Q: If "Cost Down" resolves and "Contract with the Abyss" is played for "The Masked Beast", is discarding a Blue Eyes from the hand still enough, or must I add monsters until the total number of post-"Cost Down" stars on the Tributed monsters equals the "The Masked Beast's" full value (8 stars)?  
    A: You will need to use extra monsters to make up the loss in stars. bishop, 02/25/2004

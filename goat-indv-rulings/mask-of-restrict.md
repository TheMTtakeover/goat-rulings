#### MASK OF RESTRICT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Fusion Material Monsters are not Tributes, so a Fusion Monster may be Special Summoned while this card is active on the field.
*   If "Mask of Restrict" is chained to a Ritual Spell Card, the effect of the Spell Card cannot resolve and no monsters are Tributed from the hand or field.
*   If "Mask of Restrict" is active, a Toon Monster that requires Tributes cannot be Special Summoned. The activation of "Mask of Restrict" cannot be chained to the Summoning of a Toon Monster, but it can be chained to the activation of "Toon World".
*   If "Mask of Restrict" is chained to the effect of "Cannon Soldier" you will still take damage because Tributing a monster is a cost of "Cannon Soldier" and is performed when the effect of "Cannon Soldier" is activated. If "Mask of Restrict" is chained to your opponentâ€™s "Share the Pain" you do not have to Tribute a monster, but your opponent still does because it is a cost.

#### SPELL CANCELLER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Spell Canceller"'s effect is similar to "Imperial Order".
*   If "Last Will"'s effect is active (its 'state' is in effect) and "Spell Canceller" is Summoned, "Spell Canceller" will not negate the effect of "Last Will".
*   You can Special Summon "Spell Canceller" with "Premature Burial"; the effect of "Premature Burial" is negated by "Spell Canceller" so if "Premature Burial" is destroyed, "Spell Canceller" is not destroyed and remains on the field.
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to a Spell Card, and Special Summon "Spell Canceller", to negate the effect of the Spell Card.
*   You can activate "Spiritualism" when "Spell Canceller" is face-up on the field because its activation and effect cannot be negated.
*   When "Spell Canceller" is face-up on the field, you can activate the Graveyard effect of "Dark Necrofear" (because it is a monster effect) and equip it to a monster, but the effect of "Dark Necrofear" after it is equipped will be negated because it is then an Equip Spell Card.

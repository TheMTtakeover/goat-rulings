#### PANDEMONIUM

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can't use "Pandemonium" to add a Fusion Monster Archfiend from the Fusion Deck to your hand, like "Fiend Skull Dragon".
*   If multiple Archfiends are destroyed at the same time by "Raigeki", you can only add 1 Archfiend from your Deck to your hand with "Pandemonium".
*   When your Archfiends controlled by your opponent are sent to your Graveyard, you can add an Archfiend from your Deck to your hand with "Pandemonium".

#### INFERNALQUEEN ARCHFIEND

Netrep Rulings:

*   The Archfiend ATK increase effect activates during both player's Standby Phases. The increase only lasts until the End Phase of that turn.
*   If the "Infernalqueen Archfiend" is removed from the field or turned face-down after the effect has resolved, the Archfiend that had its ATK boosted will retain that attack increase until the End Phase of the turn.
*   If an Archfiend that has received the ATK increase from the "Infernalqueen Archfiend" is turned face-down or removed from the field, the ATK increase is lost.
*   You do not have to select the same face-up Archfiend monster during every Standby Phase.
*   “Infernalqueen Archfiend” may target a different Archfiend monster each Standby Phase.

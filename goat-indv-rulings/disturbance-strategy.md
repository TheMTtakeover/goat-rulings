#### DISTURBANCE STRATEGY

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Disturbance Strategy” is chained to an effect that Special Summons a monster from the hand and the monster is no longer in the hand after the resolution of “Disturbance Strategy,” the effect that would Special Summon the monster disappears.
*   You can chain "Disturbance Strategy" to a Ritual Spell Card and then, if your opponent no longer has the Ritual Monster Card in hand when the Ritual Spell Card resolves, then the effect of the Ritual Spell Card disappears.
*   You can also chain "Disturbance Strategy" to "Polymerization" and, if the opponent no longer has the Fusion Material Monsters (if they were in his hand for example) then the effect of "Polymerization" disappears.

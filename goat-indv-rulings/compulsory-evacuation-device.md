*   If you bounce an attacking monster during the Battle Step with the effect of “Compulsory Evacuation Device”, it does not cause a replay.
*   If you bounce the defending monster with the effect of “Compulsory Evacuation Device”, it does trigger a replay.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, can you chain “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to the effect of a Flip Effect Monster when its Flip Summoned such as “Fiber Jar” or “Cyber Jar” and resolve their effects?  
    A: Yes, you can chain "Compusory Evacuation Device" to the flip effect of "Cyber Jar" and "Fiber Jar" when you Flip Summon them. The "Cyber Jar"/"Fiber Jar" would return to your hand first, then its effect would resolve. Since it would not be face-up on the field when its effect resolves, "Skill Drain" will not negate it.

#### KISETAI

Netrep Rulings:

*   When “Kiseitai” equips itself to a monster as a result of its effect, that monster is the only correct target for “Kiseitai.”
*   When “Kiseitai’s” effect triggers, “Kiseitai” is placed in the Spell/Trap zone of the controller of “Kiseitai.”
*   A face-down “Kiseitai” that is attacked while “Skill Drain” is active will not resolve its effect properly.

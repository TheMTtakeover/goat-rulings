#### SNATCH STEAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your opponent's monster on your side of the field that you control with "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal" is removed with "Different Dimension Gate", it returns to your side of the field when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed, and then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   If your opponent equips “Snatch Steal” to your “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, the effect of “Snatch Steal” resolves first and control changes. Then the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates and your opponent gets to select which monster is destroyed.
*   If you control your opponent's monster because of "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal", and remove the monster with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", the monster returns to your side of the field, then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   When your opponent activates "Snatch Steal", and you chain "Ojama Trio" to fill up his/her remaining Monster Zones, then there is no room for the stolen monster, and it is destroyed.
*   When "Snatch Steal" is active, the +1000 Life Points effect is applied even if "Remove Brainwashing" has returned control of the monster to the original owner.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If more than one “Snatch Steal” is equipped to the same monster, the later “Snatch Steal” will take precedence for purposes of determining control.
*   If “Snatch Steal” leaves the field, the monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” will return to the control of the previous controller.
*   If the monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” is turned face-down, “Snatch Steal” will be sent to the Graveyard and the monster will remain under the control of the controller of “Snatch Steal.”
*   If a monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” changes control via “Creature Swap,” “Snatch Steal” will remain equipped to the original monster, but control will not shift back. The opponent of the controller of “Snatch Steal” will continue to regain 1000 LP per Standby Phase as long as “Snatch Steal” remains on the field.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a player has all 5 Monster Zone spaces full when their opponent’s “Snatch Steal” is destroyed, what will happen to the monster their opponent was controlling with the destroyed “Snatch Steal”?  
    A: The returning monster would be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/28/2004
*   Q: If I have used “Snatch Steal” on a monster from another turn and activate “Tailor of the Fickle” on “Snatch Steal,” can I steal another monster and keep both, or do I only get one?  
    A: You would keep the new equipped monster. The monster formerly equipped with “Snatch Steal” would return to your opponent's side of the field. Steve Okegawa, 12/14/2003
*   Q: Can “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” be activated to destroy an opponent’s monster if all 5 Monster Zone spaces are full or does it only happen during the resolution of a chain?  
    A: It is during the resolution of a chain. If you do not have any empty zones in your Monster Zone you cannot activate "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal" to take control of an opponent's monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004
*   Q: Say Player A plays “Snatch Steal” on Player B’s “Jinzo”. Then Player B uses “Change of Heart” on “Jinzo” and then “Book of Moon”. What would happen to “Jinzo”?  
    A: During the End Phase “Jinzo” would return to the previous controller. Player A, based on your example. Curtis Schultz, 01/18/2004

#### MIND CONTROL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Mind Control” that prevents the targeted monster from attacking or being Tributed lasts until the End Phase of the turn ”Mind Control” was activated, even if the monster is flipped face-down before the End Phase. If the monster targeted with this card is flipped face-down, it will still return to the original owner's side of the field during the End Phase.

Judge List Rulings:

*   The monster you take control of with "Mind Control" cannot be Tributed. You cannot Tribute it to summon a high-level monster. You cannot Tribute it with "Metamorphosis." You cannot Tribute it for "Enemy Controller." You cannot Tribute it with "Share the Pain." You cannot Tribute it with "Cannon Soldier." Curtis Schultz, 02/20/2005

#### ANTE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Ante" is the only card in your hand, you cannot activate it.
*   If your opponent has no cards in his hand, you cannot activate "Ante".
*   You select cards at the resolution of "Ante"'s effect, not at "Ante"'s activation.
*   You cannot chain "Barrel Behind the Door" to "Ante" because you don't know for certain whether you will take damage.
*   If either player chains "Raigeki Break" or "Last Turn" to "Ante" and then has no cards at resolution of "Ante"'s effect, "Ante"'s effect disappears.
*   When "A Legendary Ocean" is active and you activate "Ante", when you check the Level, treat the Levels of WATER monsters in the hand as 1 lower for purposes of "Ante".
*   Netrep Rulings:
*   If “Cost Down” has successfully resolved before “Ante” resolves, the monster chosen by the player who activated “Cost Down” is reduced by 2 Level Stars as per the effect of “Cost Down.”

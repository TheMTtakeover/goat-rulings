#### GERM INFECTION

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Germ Infection’s” ATK reducing effect continues even after the ATK of the equipped monster is reduced to 0.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Germ Infection’s” decrease continue to accumulate even after the ATK has reached 0?  
    A: The decrease in ATK will continue to accumulate. So, if I have a "White Magicial Hat" equipped with "Germ Infection" for 4 Standby Phases, it would be receiving -1200 to its ATK. (I would treat its ATK as 0, since 1000 - 1200 = -200) If I were to equip an "Axe of Despair" to that same "White Magicial Hat," its ATK would be 1000 + 1000 \[Axe\] - 1200 \[Germ Infection\] = 800 ATK.

#### MONSTER REINCARNATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can select a card discarded by the effect of "Monster Reincarnation" as a target of the effect of that same "Monster Reincarnation" (returning the monster to your hand).
*   If you discard "Night Assailant" or "Makyura the Destructor" their effects activate even if you retrieve the same card.

#### RESCUE CAT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If one of the monsters Special Summoned by “Rescue Cat”’s effect is flipped face-down, or removed from play temporarily, the effect of “Rescue Cat” is reset and that monster is not destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If your opponent controls your “Rescue Cat” and activates its effect, your opponent gets the effect and Special Summons Beast-Type monsters from his/her Deck.
*   You can activate the effect of “Rescue Cat” even if there is only 1 or zero Level 3 or lower Beast-Type monsters in your Deck. However, in this case you cannot Special Summon any Beast-Type monsters for the effect of “Rescue Cat”, and your opponent gets to check your Deck to confirm.

#### DARKNESS APPROACHES

Netrep Rulings:

*   Face-up Attack position monsters may be turned to face-down Attack position by the effect of “Darkness Approaches.”
*   Monsters turned to Face-down Attack position by “Darkness Approaches” may be Flip Summoned as normal.
*   Monsters turned to Face-down Attack position by “Darkness Approaches” that are changed to Defense Position are not flipped.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is in Face Down Attack position through the effect of “Darkness Approaches” will its effect activate when it is attacked?  
    A: "Reflect Bounder's" effect will activate after it is flipped face-up by the attack. "Reflect Bounder" is flipped face-up before damage calculation. That is why its effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004

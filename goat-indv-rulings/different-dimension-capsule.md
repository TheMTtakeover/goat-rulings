#### DIFFERENT DIMENSION CAPSULE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Different Dimension Capsule" is destroyed with "Heavy Storm", etc., the card removed from play remains removed from play for the rest of the Duel.
*   If "Imperial Order" is activated, count the Standby Phases normally for "Different Dimension Capsule". If "Imperial Order" is active during the 2nd Standby Phase, you cannot add the removed card to your hand and "Different Dimension Capsule" stays on the field meaninglessly, and the removed card remains removed from play for the rest of the Duel.
*   If "Imperial Order" is chained to the activation of "Different Dimension Capsule", then the effect of selecting a card from your Deck disappears and "Different Dimension Capsule" is destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters turned face-down and removed from play by the effect of “Different Dimension Capsule” may not be returned to play by the effect of “Miracle Dig” or “Dimension Fusion.”

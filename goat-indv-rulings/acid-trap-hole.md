#### ACID TRAP HOLE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   A face-down "Jinzo" will be destroyed by this card.
*   If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as "Enraged Muka Muka", calculate the current DEF, then determine if it will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in your hand, "Enraged Muka Muka" would not be destroyed.
*   If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected monster is 2000 or less, such as a "Hane-Hane", it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Acid Trap Hole” is activated in a Chain, at what point does its target Flip Effect resolve? Is it immediately DURING the Chain or immediately AFTER the Chain?  
    A: After the chain. bishop, 01/28/2004
*   Q: What happens if I activate “Acid Trap Hole” in the Battle Step of a Battle Phase? Would I resolve the Flip Effect in the damage step? Could I Chain to the Flip Effect in this case?  
    A: The Flip Effect would start a new Chain in the Battle Step. You can respond to it with appropriate card effects. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004

#### STRIKE NINJA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Strike Ninja"'s effect during the Damage Step.

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

*   Q: Can "Strike Ninja" return in the End Phase if my monster zones are full from having activated "Return from the Different Dimension" previously this turn?  
    A: Yes. Since both "Strike Ninja" and "Return from the Different Dimension" will resolve in the End Phase you can choose in which order this will happen. You can choose to resolve "Return from the Different Dimension" and then resolve "Strike Ninja". In this instance "Strike Ninja" will return to the field. If you choose to resolve "Strike Ninja" before "Return from the Different Dimension" then it will be sent to the graveyard.

#### FALLING DOWN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If there are no Archfiends on your side of the field, "Falling Down" is destroyed immediately, even in the middle of a chain.
*   The Archfiend you need for "Falling Down" doesn't have to be a monster. Cards like "Axe of Despair", or an Archfiend monster equipped to your "Relinquished", will prevent "Falling Down" from being destroyed.
*   You can activate "Falling Down" when there are no Archfiends on your side of the field, but it is destroyed immediately before it is equipped to a monster.
*   You cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door" against the damage from "Falling Down" because you cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door" against a Continuous or Equip Spell Card.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Falling Down” takes control of an Archfi end monster, and the controlling player’s only other Archfiend card is removed from the field, “Falling Down” is not destroyed by its effect.
*   “Falling Down” may be activated as long as there is an Archfi end on the controller’s field. This includes non-monster Archfiends.

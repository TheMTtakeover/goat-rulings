#### THE DRAGON'S BEAD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you first activate this card (flip it face-up) you do not have to activate its effect. You cannot flip this card and activate its effect in the same chain. (See "Chains, Activation, and Resolution" in the Advanced FAQ.)
*   If "The Dragon’s Bead" is already face-up on the field, you may activate it multiple times in the same chain, but you must discard 1 card from you hand as a cost for each activation.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "The Dragon’s Bead" during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "The Dragon’s Bead" to negate a Trap Card that has already resolved, such as a "Nightmare Wheel" the opponent activated on a previous turn.
*   You can only activate the effect of this card to negate a Trap Card that targets a face-up Dragon-Type monster, so it cannot negate "Mirror Force", "Waboku", "Torrential Tribute", "Bottomless Trap Hole", etc.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “The Dragon’s Bead” must already be active to negate a Trap targeting a Dragon-Type.

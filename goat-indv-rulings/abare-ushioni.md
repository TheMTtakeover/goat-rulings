#### ABARE USHIONI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you call the coin toss wrong for “Abare Ushioni” you can still prevent the damage with “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, etc.
*   You cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the effect of “Abare Ushioni” because you don’t know yet if you will take damage or not from the effect.

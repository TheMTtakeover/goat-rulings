#### DRAGONIC ATTACK

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “DNA Surgery” and “Dragonic Attack” are both active, the latter one to resolve takes precedence.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Dragonic Attack” is equipped to a Warrior-Type monster changing it to Dragon-Type, would “Lord of D.” negate the effect of “Dragonic Attack” and destroy it?  
    A: The effect of "Dragonic Attack" would still be applied. "Lord of D." has no affect on effects that targeted a Dragon-Type monster before "Lord of D." was on the field. This would include the Warrior-Type that becomes a Dragon-Type because of "Dragonic Attack." Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004

#### TROOP DRAGON

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: When the third "Troop Dragon" is destroyed, is your opponent allowed to inspect your deck to verify that you do not have another "Troop Dragon" to Special Summon?  
    A: Yes they can. It should not take long to do this. The Deck would need to be shuffled afterwards, naturally. Curtis Schultz, 02/01/2004

#### ARSENAL SUMMONER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can add a card to your hand with "Guardian" in its name as long as it's not listed on "Arsenal Summoner", such as "Guardian of the Throne Room" or "Guardian Sphinx".
*   You must show your opponent the card you retrieved with "Arsenal Summoner".
*   If you don't have any "Guardian" monsters you can retrieve when you activate "Arsenal Summoner"'s effect, you must show your Deck to your opponent to prove it.

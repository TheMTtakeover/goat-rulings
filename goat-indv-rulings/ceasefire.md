#### CEASEFIRE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Ceasefire” does not affect face-down Attack Position monsters.
*   If “Ceasefire” is activated in a Chain to the Flip Effect of a Flip Summoned monster, “Ceasefire” will resolve first, but the Flip Effect will resolve successfully.
*   “Ceasefire” can be activated if one of two conditions are met: 1) There is a face-down Defense position monster on the field. 2) There is a face-up Effect monster on the field.
*   Monster Tokens are not considered Effect monsters for the effect of “Ceasefire.”
*   If a face down “Jinzo” is flipped face up by “Ceasefire,” “Ceasefire’s” effect will completely resolve before “Jinzo’s” effect of negating all Traps resolves.

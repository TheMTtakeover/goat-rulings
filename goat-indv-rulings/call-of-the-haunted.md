Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Call Of The Haunted” was used to Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard and then “Book of Moon” was activated, or the monster’s own effect such as “Guardian Sphinx”, what would happen?  
    A: The targeted monster would be changed to face-down Defense Position and would then be severed from the effect of "Call of the Haunted." Even if the monster is later flipped face-up, it will still remain severed from the effect of "Call of the Haunted." "Call of the Haunted" will remain on the field meaninglessly.

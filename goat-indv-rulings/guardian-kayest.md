#### GUARDIAN KAY'EST

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Guardian Kay'est" is not affected by Spell Cards, just like "The Legendary Fisherman".
*   Your opponent cannot select "Guardian Kay'est" as the target of an attack.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" is your only monster on the field, your opponent can attack your Life Points directly.
*   As long as "Guardian Kay'est" cannot be selected as the target of an attack, it cannot be targeted by the effect of "Staunch Defender", either.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" and another monster are targeted for "Different Dimension Gate", only the other monster is removed from play and returns when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" and another monster are selected for "Creature Swap"'s effect, "Creature Swap"'s effect is negated because switching is impossible.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: What happens if my opponent has 2 “Guardian Kay’est” on the field? (Can I attack directly still even though they have more than one?).  
    A: Having 2 "Guardian Kay'est" is no different from just 1. Whether your opponent has 1, 2, or 3 of them on the field, you are still able to attack directly. This is assuming that they have no other monsters on the field, of course. Steve Okegawa, 02/22/04
*   Q: If my opponent attacks one of my monsters, can I activate “Staunch Defender” and choose “Guardian Kay’est?”  
    A: "Guardian Kay'est" would not be a valid target for "Staunch Defender" because your opponent cannot attack "Guardian Kay'est." This is due to the effect of "Guardian Kay'est." Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004

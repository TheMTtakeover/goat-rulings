#### QUESTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Remember that you cannot shuffle your Graveyard or change the order of cards in your Graveyard at any time.
*   If a monster is named with "Question" that could not be Special Summoned, "Question"’s effect disappears and the monster is neither Special Summoned nor removed from play. So the effect of "Question" disappears if the bottom monster is incorrectly named and is "Helpoemer", "Dark Ruler Ha Des", etc.
*   If you would Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon" from the Graveyard using "Question", you must Tribute 1 Dragon and if you cannot you cannot Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon" and the effect of "Question" disappears
*   Netrep Rulings:
*   If a monster that has Special Summon requirements that was not properly Summoned is at the bottom of the Graveyard when “Question” is activated, that monster will not be Special Summoned.
*   If the opposing player activates a card that alters the Graveyard in a chain with “Question,” that player may still not look in the player who activated “Question’s” graveyard.

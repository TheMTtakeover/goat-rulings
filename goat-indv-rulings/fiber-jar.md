#### FIBER JAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When this card’s effect is activated all cards on the field, in hand, and in the Graveyards are returned to their owner’s Deck. Fusion Monster Cards in any of these places are returned to the Fusion Deck. Cards removed from play remain removed from play.
*   When the effect of "Fiber Jar" is activated, "Fiber Jar" itself is united with the Deck, even if it has been attacked and destroyed as a result of battle.
*   If the effect of "Fiber Jar" activates during the Battle Phase, it does not end the Battle Phase, although the turn player will have no monsters after the effect resolves.
*   If your opponent’s "Parasite Paracide" is face-up in your Deck when the effect of "Fiber Jar" is activated, it will remain there. The opponent should cut your Deck with his / her eyes closed after you shuffle to ensure fairness.
*   If "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is returned to the Deck by the effect of "Fiber Jar" and its effect has already been used once this Duel, that condition is not reset. If you again draw and Summon your "Twin-Headed Behemoth" you may not activate its effect again.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters with Special Summon requirements that were properly summoned and returned to the Deck by the effect of “Fiber Jar” will require being summoned properly again.
*   "Fiber Jar” does not cease the turn count of “Final Countdown.”
*   If “Lesser Fiend” destroys a “Fiber Jar”, “Fiber Jar’s” effect will occur at the "resolve effects" stage, removing “Lesser Fiend” from the field. “Fiber Jar” will not be removed from play.
*   If “Serpentine Princess” is face up when “Fiber Jar” resolves, the effect of “Serpentine Princess” resolves after the effect of “Fiber Jar” fully resolves.
*   “Necrovalley” negates the effect of “Fiber Jar.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Player A: Activates “Raigeki”. Player B: Chains with “Ceasefire”. Player A: Chains with “Acid Trap Hole” and targets their face-down “Fiber Jar”. Will the effect of “Fiber Jar” be added to the current chain or will it start a new chain?  
    A: "Fiber Jar's" effect would begin a new chain once the current one has resolved completely. Curtis Schultz, 02/15/2004
*   Q: If “Fiber Jar” is activated when there are “Scapegoat” Tokens on the field, are the tokens removed from the field?  
    A: Tokens are treated as monsters and would be removed from the field by the effect of "Fiber Jar". However, because they are Tokens, they are not sent to the Graveyard, but rather removed from play. bishop, 02/02/2004

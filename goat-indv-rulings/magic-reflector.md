#### MAGIC REFLECTOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can put 2 or more counters on a Spell Card if you activate 2 or more "Magic Reflectors". When the Spell Card is destroyed, remove the counters on it 1-by-1.
*   You can activate "Magic Reflector" and put a counter on a Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished", and if the equipped card would be destroyed, remove 1 counter instead.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active, and if a Spell Card with a counter on it would be destroyed, the counter is removed instead. "Imperial Order" does not negate the function of counters created by the effect of "Magic Reflector".
*   If a Spell Card with a maintenance cost has a counter on it, such as "Messenger of Peace", and you choose not to pay the cost, the Spell Card is still destroyed.
*   If a Field Spell Card has a counter on it and a player activates a new Field Spell Card, the Field Spell Card with the counter is still destroyed.
*   If "Swords of Revealing Light" has a counter on it, it is still destroyed at the end of the opponent’s third turn after it was activated.
*   If you use "Magic Reflector" to place a counter on a Union Monster that is an Equip Card, and the Union Monster would be destroyed instead of the equipped monster, remove the "Magic Reflector" counter from the Union Monster instead, and the Union Monster is not destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Magic Reflector” does not produce a Spell Counter for the purposes of cards that use Spell Counters.
*   “Magic Reflector” will not prevent the affected Spell Card from being sent to the Graveyard if it was not destroyed.
*   “Magic Reflector” will not prevent the affected Spell Card from returning to the hand as that action does not destroy the Spell Card.
*   Multiple copies of “Magic Reflector” may be used on the same face-up Spell Card.

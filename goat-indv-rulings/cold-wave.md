#### COLD WAVE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Cold Wave” may be chained to by appropriate Quick-Play Spell Cards or Trap Cards.
*   “Cold Wave” will prevent the activation of activated continuous effects, such as those of “Ultimate Offering” or “Call of the Mummy.”
*   If “Cold Wave’s” activation and effect are negated, a second “Cold Wave” may not be played that turn.
*   Union monsters may still use their effect of equipping themselves to an appropriate monster if “Cold Wave” has been activated.
*   If “Cold Wave” has been activated, “Cocoon of Evolution” may not be equipped onto “Petit Moth.”
*   If “Cold Wave” has been activated, “Thousand Eyes Restrict” may still use its effect to force a monster to equip to it.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: “Cold Wave” negates continuous spell and or trap cards, this includes equipments too, right?  
    A: “Cold Wave” makes it so you can't "play" (activate) or "Set" Spell or Trap Cards, and extends to "activating" effects of Spell/Trap Cards already on the field. But “Cold Wave” will not negate continuous effects of cards like “United We Stand” that were in play BEFORE “Cold Wave” was activated. bishop, 12/08/2003

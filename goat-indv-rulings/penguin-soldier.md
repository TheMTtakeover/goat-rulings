#### PENGUIN SOLDIER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You may choose to return 0, 1, or 2 monsters to their owners’ hands.
*   You may target Monster Tokens, and they will be taken off the field, instead of returning to the hand.
*   Spirit Monsters can still be returned to their owners’ hands by the effect of "Penguin Soldier" even if "Spiritual Energy Settle Machine" is in play.

Netrep Rulings:

*   "Penguin Soldier's" effect DOES "specifically designate a target" for purposes of "Lord of D.," etc.
*   "Penguin Soldier" SOMETIMES "specifically designates 1 monster as a target" so for "Chaos Command Magician" or "Metalsilver Armor", if "Penguin Soldier" is targeting ONE monster then it's "specifically designating 1 monster as a target". If Penguin Soldier targets TWO monsters then it does "specifically designate a target" but it does NOT "specifically designate 1 target".

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can the effect of “Precious Cards from Beyond” be used when summoning “Lava Golem” to the opponent’s side of the field?  
    A: The effect of "Lava Golem" is not a Tribute Summon. It will not work with the effect of "Precious Cards from Beyond." Tribute Summons are Normal Summons of 5+ Level Star monsters by offering Tributes. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004

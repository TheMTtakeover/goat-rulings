#### 7

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 3 "7"'s and destroy them all, you get 2100 Life Points.
*   If your opponent also has "7"'s, they are also destroyed.
*   If you have 3 "7"'s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain "Imperial Order" to negate the effect.
*   Each effect of "7" that gives you 700 Life Points goes on a chain, so if multiple "7"'s are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the chain.
*   If other cards are also sent to the Graveyard at the same time, like "Sangan" or "Black Pendant", the card controlled by the turn player is Step 1.
*   If your 3rd "7" is activated, but destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon" in a chain, you can't activate its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its Graveyard effect.

#### ZOLGA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your opponent Tribute Summons with your "Zolga" using "Soul Exchange", the controller of "Zolga" increases his Life Points.
*   When your opponent takes your "Zolga" with "Change of Heart" and Tribute Summons with it, your opponent (the controller of "Zolga" when it was Tributed) increases his Life Points.
*   When a Tribute Summon using "Zolga" is negated by "Solemn Judgment", you don't increase your Life Points.
*   The effect of "Zolga" can be chained to, and is Step 1 of a chain after a successful Summon. Effects like "Trap Hole" would be Step 2.
*   When you Tribute Summon with 2 "Zolgas", both "Zolgas" effects are activated.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Zolga’s” Life Point increase effect also apply to Ritual Tribute requirements?  
    A: Nope. “Zolga”’s effect only applies to a Tribute Summon or Set. A Ritual Summon, although requiring Tributes, only counts as a Ritual Summon/Special Summon. Steve Okegawa, 01/15/2004

#### INTERDIMENSIONAL MATTER TRANSPORTER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   A monster removed with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" doesn't occupy a Monster Card Zone. If there are no Monster Card Zones available when it returns, it is destroyed.
*   If you control your opponent's monster because of "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal", and remove the monster with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", the monster returns to your side of the field, then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   A monster returned to the field because of "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" returns in the same Battle Position that it was in when it was removed from the field.
*   If a Spirit Monster is returned to the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" the same turn it was Summoned or flipped face-up, it returns to the field and then returns to the owner's hand.
*   When a Fusion Monster is returned to the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" the same turn it was Special Summoned with "Summoner of Illusions" or "Magical Scientist", the Fusion Monster is not destroyed or returned to the Fusion Deck.
*   When an Archfiend is returned to the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" after it was Special Summoned with "Archfiend's Roar", it is not destroyed by "Archfiend's Roar"'s effect.
*   When "Karate Man", or a monster affected by "Limiter Removal", is removed from play with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", it is not destroyed that turn because the effect of "Karate Man"/"Limiter Removal" is reset.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If control of a monster is changed via “Snatch Steal” or “Change of Heart” and is removed from the field by “Interdimensional Matter Transporter,” when the monster returns during the End Phase, control of the monster will return to the original controller.
*   If a “Goblin Attack Force” that has already attacked and is in Defense position is removed from the field by “Interdimensional Matter Transporter,” “Goblin Attack Force” will return to the field in Defense position. Its position may be manually changed at the next legal opportunity.
*   If a “Mirage Knight” that has been involved in Damage Calculations is removed from the field by “Interdimensional Matter Transporter,” “Mirage Knight” will still be removed from play when it returns to the field during the End Phase.
*   If “Zombyra the Dark” is removed from the field by “Interdimensional Matter Transporter,” when “Zombyra the Dark” returns to the field, it will return at 2100 ATK, regardless of how many monsters it had destroyed previously.

#### MUSHROOM MAN #2

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: When you give control of “Mushroom Man #2” to your opponent, can your opponent use its effect during their turn to give control back to you?  
    A: Yes they can. In this way the “Mushroom Man #2” can have control passed between the two players for multiple turns by paying the 500 Life Point cost during their End Phase. Curtis Schultz, 12/10/2003

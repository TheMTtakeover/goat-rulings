#### SOLEMN JUDGMENT

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Solemn Judgment” can not be used to negate a Special Summon if that Special Summon occurs as a result of another card effect.
*   Special Summon monsters like “Dark Necrofear” that have their summons negated by “Solemn Judgment” are not considered properly summoned and may not be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a person uses “Solemn Judgment” and the resulting Life Points results in a decimal, what happens? Does it round up or down?  
    A: If equal or more than 0.5, round up. If less than 0.5, round down. bishop, 01/20/2004

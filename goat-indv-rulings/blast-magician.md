#### BLAST MAGICIAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If “Rush Recklessly” is chained to the effect of “Blast Magician”, and the ATK of the target monster is now higher than 700 x the number of Spell Counters removed, the effect of “Blast Magician” disappears. You cannot remove additional Spell Counters to increase the effect.
*   This is an effect that targets.
*   You must remove at least 1 Spell Counter. You cannot activate the effect and remove zero Spell Counters.
*   As with all Spell Counters, the Spell Counter is placed when the Spell Card resolves, not when it is activated, but “Blast Magician” must have been face-up on the field when the Spell Card was activated (and when it resolves) in order to receive a Spell Counter.

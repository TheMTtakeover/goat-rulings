#### DIMENSION JAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can use "Dimension Jar"'s effect for zero to three cards, so even if your opponent has less than 3 monsters in his Graveyard you can still use "Dimension Jar"'s effect.
*   When "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" is on the field and "Dimension Jar" is activated, the controller of "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" can remove his/her opponent's cards in the Graveyard from play.

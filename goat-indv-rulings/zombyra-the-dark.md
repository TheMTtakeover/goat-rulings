Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Will “Zombyra the Dark's” attack decrease from the modified ATK caused by “Adhesion Trap Hole” (1050), or will it decrease from the original ATK (2100) and then the effect from “Adhesion Trap Hole” take effect each time it destroys a monster. i.e., “Zombyra the Dark” destroys a monster. Is its ATK now 850 or 950?  
    A: “Adhesion Trap Hole” will only cause the original ATK of the monster to be halved. So in “Zombyra the Dark's” case, “Adhesion Trap Hole” will cause it to be at 1050 ATK after being summoned. Then, “Zombyra the Dark's” effect will cause it to lose 200 ATK points each time it destroys a monster. After destroying 1 monster, “Zombyra the Dark's” ATK value will be 850.

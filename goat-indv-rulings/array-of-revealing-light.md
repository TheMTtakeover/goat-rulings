#### ARRAY OF REVEALING LIGHT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You declare the Type of monster when you activate this card, not when it resolves. This means you pick the Type before the opponent decides whether to chain or not.
*   You cannot change your mind about the Type after you activate this card. The declared Type remains the same as long as this card is on the field.
*   This card does not target, so the effects of "Lord of D." or "Frontier Wiseman" will not protect monsters from this cardâ€™s effect.
*   If the Type of a monster is changed (by the effect of "DNA Surgery" for example) during the turn which it was Summoned, it may attack that turn.

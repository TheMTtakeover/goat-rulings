#### SUPER REJUVENATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the effect of "DNA Surgery" is making all monsters on the field Dragon-Type, the ones that are Tributed will count for "Super Rejuvenation".
*   You can activate "Super Rejuvenation" at any time outside the Damage Step, and the effect will be applied during the End Phase.
*   Multiple copies of "Super Rejuvenation" are cumulative. So if you activate two copies during your Main Phase 1 and Tribute two Dragon-Type monsters during the course of the turn, you will draw 4 cards in the End Phase.
*   If you have "Solemn Wishes" active on the field, you can increase your Life Points by the number of cards you draw for the effect of "Super Rejuvenation" x 500. So if you drew 2 cards by its effect, you can increase your Life Points by 1000.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters changed to Dragon Type and Tributed are eligible for “Super Rejuvenation’s” effect.
*   Dragon-Type monsters Tributed on the opponent’s field are not counted for the purpose of “Super Rejuvenation.”
*   Dragon-Type monsters Tributed on your field by your opponent, through the effect of “Lava Golem” or similar are counted for “Super Rejuvenation."

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “X-Head Cannon” and “Z-Metal Tank” are on the field and “Y-Dragon Head” is equipped to “X-Head Cannon” through its effect, can the three cards be removed from play to Special Summon the “XYZ-Dragon Cannon”?  
    A: They would need to be monsters at the time you would remove them from play to Special Summon the associated XYZ Fusion monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004
*   Q: If “X-Head Cannon”, “Y-Dragon Head”, and “Z-Metal Tank” are used to attack the opponent, can they be removed from play to Special Summon “XYZ-Dragon Cannon” during the Battle Phase to attack the opponent once again?  
    A: You cannot perform the Special Summon of “XYZ Dragon Cannon” (per its instructions) during your Battle Phase. The XZ, XY, YZ, and XYZ can only be Special Summoned by the method written on each respective monster during Main Phase 1 and 2 of your turn only. Curtis Schultz, 02/24/2004

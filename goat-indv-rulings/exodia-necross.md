#### EXODIA NECROSS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Exodia Necross" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "Contract with Exodia". So "Exodia Necross" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   Players can activate Spell & Trap Card effects that destroy monsters, but "Exodia Necross" will not be destroyed by them.
*   If a piece of Exodia is removed from the Graveyard while "Exodia Necross" is removed from play due to "Dimensionhole", "Exodia Necross" is destroyed when it returns to the field.
*   If your opponent takes control of your "Exodia Necross" and does not have all 5 pieces of Exodia in his/her Graveyard, "Exodia Necross" is destroyed if face-up.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, "Exodia Necross"' ATK is returned to its original 1800 points. Even if "Skill Drain" then leaves play, "Exodia Necross" does no regain any ATK increases it had because of its effect, but it will begin to accumulate ATK points again.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, "Exodia Necross" is not destroyed if Exodia pieces are removed from the Graveyard, but it will be destroyed if the effect of "Skill Drain" disappears.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a face-down “Exodia Necross” is flipped as a result of battle when the controlling player does not have all 5 pieces of Exodia in the Graveyard, that “Exodia Necross” will be destroyed after Damage Calculation.
*   A face-down “Exodia Necross” may be destroyed by Spell or Trap effects if those effects destroy “Exodia Necross” while it remains face-down.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Exodia Necross” is face-up on the field when “Fiber Jar” is flipped, will “Exodia Necross” remain on the field or be returned to the Deck?

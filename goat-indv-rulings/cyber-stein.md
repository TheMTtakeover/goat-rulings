#### CYBER-STEIN

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

*   If “Cyber-Stein” is summoned while “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field, the turn player is not able to use the effect “Cyber-Stein” before it is destroyed. The trigger effect of “King Tiger Wanghu” is a mandatory trigger that goes on the chain in response to a Summon before either player can manually respond, so while the Turn Player will still retain priority, they will only be able to use a spell speed 2 or 3 effect with it.

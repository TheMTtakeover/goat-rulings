#### BURNING LAND

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Burning Land” may only be activated if there is a Field Spell Card on the field.
*   “Burning Land” may destroy a face-down Field Spell card.

Judge List Rulings:

*   The field-destruction effect \[of "Burning Land"\] is a one-time deal that only happens when the card first resolves. The only continuous effect is the damage it inflicts. Curtis Schultz, 01/21/2005

#### METAMORPHOSIS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Metamorphosis does not properly Summon a Fusion Monster, so you cannot use "Monster Reborn" on it afterwards.
*   Tributing a monster is a cost.
*   You can Tribute a face-down monster.
*   If you activated “Soul Exchange” targeting your opponent’s monster, if the monster is face-down, you cannot Tribute it as a cost for “Metamorphosis”.
*   You can Tribute a Monster Token (including a Sheep Token from "Scapegoat").
*   If there is no monster with the same level as the Tributed monster in your Fusion Deck, then you cannot activate this card.
*   "Metamorphosis" vs. "A Legendary Ocean": if you want to Special Summon a Level 6 Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck, you have to Tribute a Level 7 WATER monster on the field because it is treated as a Level 6.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The player activating “Metamorphosis” must have a Fusion monster of the appropriate level that can be Special Summoned in his or her Fusion Deck.

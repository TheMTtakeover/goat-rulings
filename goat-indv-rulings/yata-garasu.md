Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If the player that controls “Yata-Garasu” repeatedly attacks his/her opponent's Life Points to inflict Battle Damage over a period of so many turns and/or until his/her opponent's Life Points reaches 0, will it be considered "stalling"?  
    A: Playing out the "Yata-Garasu" effect is NOT considered stalling. However, your opponent must be allowed to concede if he/she chooses and there is no foreseeable manner to avoid a game loss. But there should not be any coercion on either player's part to sit through the effect multiple times or to be forced to play it out needlessly. bishop, 02/01/2004

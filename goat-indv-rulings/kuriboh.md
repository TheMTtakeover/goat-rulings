Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can “Kuriboh” be used after “Injection Fairy Lily” uses its effect to boost the ATK?  
    A: “Kuriboh” CAN be used to reduce the damage from “Injection Fairy Lily” to 0, even after “Injection Fairy Lily's” effect has been used in the Damage Step. Steve Okegawa, 12/07/2003
*   Q: Player A plays “Injection Fairy Lily” and declares the use of effect. Player B discards a “Kuriboh,” flips a “Waboku,” etc. Does Player A still take the 2000 points of damage for the use of effect?  
    A: You can discard “Kuriboh” during the damage step after “Injection Fairy Lily's” effect has been activated. The player that activated “Injection Fairy Lily's” effect will still pay 2000 Life Points and increase her attack by 3000. You cannot activate “Waboku” during the Damage Step. The cost for “Injection Fairy Lily” is just that, a cost. It is not "damage". Curtis Schultz, 12/04/2003

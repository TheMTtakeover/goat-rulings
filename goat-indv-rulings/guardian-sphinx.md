#### GUARDIAN SPHINX

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Guardian Sphinx” is turned face down, all Equip Spell Cards equipped to “Guardian Sphinx” are sent to the Graveyard.
*   If “Guardian Sphinx” is in face-up Defense Position and uses its effect to turn it to face-down Defense Position, “Guardian Sphinx” may be Flip Summoned if it has not had another position change, or was summoned, this turn.
*   If a “Guardian Sphinx” Special Summoned by the effect of “Call of the Haunted” successfully uses its effect to turn itself face down, “Call of the Haunted” remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   If “Guardian Sphinx” is Flip Summoned and “Torrential Tribute” is chained to the effect, “Torrential Tribute” will resolve first destroying all monsters on the field.

#### TOON MONSTERS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This rule applies for "Toon Mermaid", "Toon Summoned Skull", "Manga Ryu-Ran" and "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon": If "Toon World" is returned to a player’s hand, with cards such as "Giant Trunade" these Toon Monsters are not destroyed since "Toon World" was not destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Toon monsters may not attack the turn they are Special Summoned, regardless of how they are Special Summoned.
*   If both players have “Toon World” on the field, if one “Toon World” is destroyed, all Toon monsters are destroyed.
*   If “Toon World” is sent to the Graveyard, but not destroyed, Toon monsters are not destroyed.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If both players have “Toon World” and Toon Monsters on their side of the field and the opponent’s “Toon World” is destroyed, would all Toon Monsters be destroyed or only the opponent’s Toon Monsters?  
    A: Both player's Toon monsters would be destroyed when a "Toon World" is destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 02/01/2004
*   Q: If a face-down “Toon World” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, are Toon Monsters on the field also destroyed?  
    A: All face-up Toon monsters would be destroyed because "Toon World" was destroyed. It does not matter if "Toon World" was face-up or face-down when it was destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 02/22/2004
*   Q: Can Sheep Tokens be used as Tributes for Toon Monsters?  
    A: Yes. bishop 02/21/2004

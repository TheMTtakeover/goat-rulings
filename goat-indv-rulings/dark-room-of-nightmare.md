#### DARK ROOM OF NIGHTMARE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   A cost is not damage so this card’s effect does not apply against "Chain Energy", or costs for "Imperial Order", etc.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Would the opponent receive damage from “Dark Room of Nightmare” when losing Life Points from the effects of “Toll” and “Chain Energy”?  
    A: The effect of “Toll” and “Chain Energy” is not damage, so “Dark Room of Nightmare” will have no involvement in those card’s effects. Curtis Schultz, 01/22/2004

#### REFLECT BOUNDER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, then damage calculation is applied normally, then "Reflect Bounder" is destroyed by its own effect.
*   When an Attack Position "Reflect Bounder" is attacked, it is destroyed by its own effect even if the ATK of "Reflect Bounder" is lower than the ATK of the attacking monster.
*   The damage inflicted by "Reflect Bounder"'s effect is not Battle Damage, so it cannot be reduced to 0 with "Waboku".
*   Effects such as "Metalmorph" and "Injection Fairy Lily" happen after "Reflect Bounder"'s effect, because "Reflect Bounder"'s effect happens before damage calculation.
*   When your opponent attacks your Attack Position "Reflect Bounder", your opponent can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Reflect Bounder"'s effect.
*   When your opponent's "White Magical Hat" with "Axe of Despair" attacks your "Reflect Bounder", "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is performed, and "White Magical Hat"'s effect is activated.
*   When "Reflect Bounder" is attacked by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is applied, "Reflect Bounder" is determined to be destroyed as a result of battle, "Dark Ruler Ha Des" negates "Reflect Bounder"'s effect, and "Reflect Bounder" does not destroy itself with its own effect, however it was still destroyed as a result of battle.
*   "Reflect Bounder"'s effect does not target.
*   If "Reflect Bounder" is attacked by "D.D. Warrior Lady", and the effect of "Reflect Bounder" is activated, "Reflect Bounder" inflicts damage, damage calculation is performed, and "Reflect Bounder" destroys itself with its own effect and is sent to the Graveyard, so even if "D.D. Warrior Lady" activates her effect, "Reflect Bounder" is not removed from play because it is already in the Graveyard.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is in Face Down Attack position through the effect of “Darkness Approaches” will its effect activate when it is attacked?  
    A: "Reflect Bounder's" effect will activate after it is flipped face-up by the attack. "Reflect Bounder" is flipped face-up before damage calculation. That is why its effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004
*   Q: If the opponent declares an attack on “Reflect Bounder” while in Defense Position and the player activates “Final Attack Orders”, will the effect of “Reflect Bounder” activate?  
    A: The effect of "Reflect Bounder" would activate. This is because it is changed to Attack Position by the effect of "Final Attack Orders" after being flipped by the attack. This all occurs before damage calculation. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004
*   Q: “Necrovalley” is face up on my side of the field. I attack my opponents face up “Reflect Bounder” with my “Gravekeeper’s Assailant”. I use “Gravekeeper’s Assailant’s” effect to change “Reflect Bounder” to defense mode. Now, do I take 2000 damage from “Reflect Bounder’s” effect, or since I changed it to defense mode, “Reflect Bounder” is destroyed by “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” taking no damage?  
    A: The effect of "Gravekeeper's Assailant" activates when you declare the attack. This is during the Battle Step. If you target "Reflect Bounder" with the "Gravekeeper's Assailant's" effect and it resolves properly, "Reflect Bounder" will be shifted to Defense Position. Then you would enter the Damage Step. Since "Reflect Bounder" is now in Defense Position, its effect will not activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/04/2004
*   Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is chosen to remain on the field for the effect of “Last Turn,” will it inflict damage to the other player?  
    A: The turn player is the one who is attacking when “Last Turn” resolves. If the person that activated “Last Turn” controls a “Reflect Bounder,” the “Reflect Bounder’s” effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/15/2004

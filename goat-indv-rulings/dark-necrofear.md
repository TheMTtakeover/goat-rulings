#### DARK NECROFEAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You only remove the 3 Fiend-Type monsters in your Graveyard from play when you Special Summon "Dark Necrofear" from your hand. If you successfully Special Summon it using this method, and then wish to use "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, you do not have to remove 3 more Fiend-Type monsters from the Graveyard.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is on the field when "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed, the "Dark Necrofear" is removed from play and does not return as an Equip Spell Card.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active when "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed while a Monster Card, it must still be equipped to your opponent’s monster, but you will not gain control of it because its effect is negated by "Imperial Order".
*   If all 5 of your Spell / Trap Card Zones are full during your End Phase of the turn "Dark Necrofear" was destroyed while a Monster Card, you cannot activate its effect, and the effect disappears.
*   If "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed, you can Special Summon it from your Graveyard with "Monster Reborn", "Premature Burial", etc. before your End Phase, and its effect will be reset.
*   If this card was discarded from your hand by an opponent’s card effect, such as "Confiscation" it does not become an Equip Spell Card during the End Phase, since it was not destroyed.
*   If the Special Summoning of "Dark Necrofear" is negated and "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed by the effect of "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven", it will become an Equip Spell Card during the End Phase.
*   "Tailor of the Fickle" or "Collected Power" can be used to move "Dark Necrofear" from one monster to another after it is an Equip Spell Card. "Fairy’s Hand Mirror" or "Shift" cannot be used when "Dark Necrofear" first becomes an Equip Spell Card and is equipped to your opponent’s monster.
*   If it is destroyed by your opponent’s "Harpie’s Feather Duster", "Dust Tornado", etc. while it is an Equip Spell Card, "Dark Necrofear" will NOT return during the End Phase since it was NOT destroyed while a Monster Card.
*   If your "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed on your opponent’s side of the field, by either player’s card effect, it will not activate during the End Phase. It must be on your side of the field and sent to your Graveyard when it is destroyed for its effect to activate.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Dark Necrofear’s” "equipping" effect is considered Targeting. “Dark Necrofear’s” "equipping" effect follows all restrictions of Equip Spell Cards.
*   “Dark Necrofear’s” "equipping" effect may not be negated by “Magic Jammer”, “Spell Shield Type 8,” or similar cards as “Dark Necrofear” is not activated as a Spell Card.
*   If “Dark Necrofear” is destroyed in the same End Phase that it equips itself to a monster, “Dark Necrofear” will not equip itself to another monster.
*   If “Dark Necrofear” does not equip a monster during the same End Phase it was destroyed in, “Dark Necrofear’s” effect disappears.
*   If the monster equipped with “Dark Necrofear” is flipped face-down by the effect of “Book of Moon,” the monster will remain under the control of the controller of “Dark Necrofear.” “Dark Necrofear” will be sent to the Graveyard as it no longer has a legal target and will not reactive it’s equipment effect.
*   If “Imperial Order” is activated while “Dark Necrofear” is equipped to a monster, “Imperial Order” will negate “Dark Necrofear’s” effect and return control to the previous controller for as long as “Imperial Order” is active. If “Imperial Order” is later negated or removed from the field, “Dark Necrofear’s” effect will no longer be negated and control of the equipped monster will return to the controller of “Dark Necrofear.”
*   If “Solemn Judgment” is used to negate the Special Summon of “Dark Necrofear,” “Dark Necrofear” will activate its equipping effect during the End Phase of that turn as “Solemn Judgment” destroyed “Dark Necrofear.” “Dark Necrofear” will not be able to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard as its Summon was negated.
*   If the monster equipped with “Dark Necrofear” changes control as a result of “Change of Heart,” that monster will remain under the new controller’s control for the duration of the turn, after which it will return to the controller of “Dark Necrofear."
*   If the monster equipped with “Dark Necrofear” changes control as a result of “Snatch Steal,” the player who activated “Snatch Steal” will maintain control of that monster until “Snatch Steal” is removed from the field or negated. The player controlling “Dark Necrofear” will gain 1000 Life Points per Standby Phase as per the effect of “Snatch Steal.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Dark Necrofear’s” effect activate if you have a full Monster field?  
    A: If your Monster Zone is full, you cannot activate the effect of "Dark Necrofear" and the effect disappears. bishop 02/23/2004
*   Q: If “Dark Necrofear’s” ATK value is lowered upon summoning and targeted by “Chain Destruction”, will the other copies of “Dark Necrofear”, which were destroyed by “Chain Destruction” activate?  
    A: Yes the “Dark Necrofears” would activate their effects during the End Phase, since they were destroyed by an opponent’s card effect. Keep in mind that they would not be able to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard as a monster though, since they were never Special Summoned once before via their effect. Curtis Schultz, 01/21/2004
*   Q: If “Dark Necrofear” is equipped to an opponent's monster, giving me control of it, and my opponent uses a card such as “Mystical Space Typhoon,” to destroy “Dark Necrofear”, can I activate "A Deal With Dark Ruler" when “Dark Necrofear” hits the graveyard?  
    A: "Dark Necrofear" was an Equip Spell Card at the time it was destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon" and sent to the Graveyard. It was not a monster. Because of this, you would not be able to activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler." Curtis Schultz, 03/04/2004

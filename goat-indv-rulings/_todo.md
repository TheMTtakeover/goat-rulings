#### SACRED CRANE

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of "Sacred Crane" does not activate if it is Special Summoned face-down.

#### SACRED PHOENIX OF NEPHTHYS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its own effect. Because this effect activates in the Graveyard, and is being negated while "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is in the Graveyard, "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is never Special Summoned (so the card is never moved from the Graveyard) and is never destroyed. Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned with “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”, and that card is destroyed and destroys “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” with its effect, you Special Summon “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while in your hand or Deck by a card effect, you still activate its effect during your next Standby Phase to Special Summon it from the Graveyard. (For example, if an effect like “Star Boy” is active, and “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” is activated to destroy other copies of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” in the hand and Deck, those copies will be Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.
*   If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that Special Summons it from the Graveyard is still activated, because it is activated in the Graveyard. However, the effect that destroys Spell and Trap Cards on the field is negated because it activates on the field (so “Skill Drain” and other Spell and Trap Cards on the field are not destroyed in this case).
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and the Summon is negated by “Horn of Heaven”, it is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.
*   If your opponent controls your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys”, and it is destroyed by a card effect, because the effect activates in the Graveyard, it is the owner that gets the effect and Special Summons “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during their Standby Phase.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed during your Draw Phase, you can Special Summon it during the Standby Phase of that same turn.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed and removed from play, such as with “Bottomless Trap Hole”, it is not Special Summoned from out of play during the Standby Phase, because this effect activates in the Graveyard.
*   If “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, and your opponent takes control of your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” while controlling monsters that are not Winged Beast-Type, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is not considered destroyed by the effect of “Rivalry of Warlords”, but rather by a condition that made it impossible for it to exist on that side of the field. So it is not Special Summoned by its own effect during the Standby Phase.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while it is not a Monster Card, such as when it is equipped to “Relinquished” or “Sword Hunter”, its effect does not activate and it is not Special Summoned.
*   You can chain to the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that destroys all Spell and Trap Cards.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its effect during the Standby Phase, and “Card of Safe Return” is on the field, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Step 1 of the chain and “Card of Safe Return” is Step 2, so “Card of Safe Return” resolves first and you draw a card before “Card of Safe Return” is destroyed.

#### SAKURETSU ARMOR

Individual Card Rulings:

*   "Sakuretsu Armor" targets 1 monster.
*   If the turn player chains "Book of Moon" to "Sakuretsu Armor" to flip the attacking monster face-down, then the attacking monster is not destroyed by "Sakuretsu Armor".

#### SALVAGE

Individual Card Rulings:

*   "Salvage" targets 2 WATER monsters in the Graveyard.
*   If 1 of the targeted WATER monsters is removed from the Graveyard by an effect chained to "Salvage", the remaining WATER monster is still added to your hand.

#### SANGA OF THE THUNDER

Individual Card Rulings:

*   A marker may be placed on this card to indicate that its effect has been used. The effect resets if the monster is destroyed or removed from the field.
*   You can use the effect of this card even if it is face-down when it is attacked because its effect is activated during the Damage Step, and it will be face-up at that point.
*   The effect of this card targets.

#### SANGAN

Individual Card Rulings:

*   You must show your opponent the monster you select from your Deck for this card’s effect. If you have no eligible monsters, your opponent gets to see your Deck to verify.
*   The effect of "Sangan" only activates when it is sent from the field to the Graveyard, not from your hand or Deck, and not if it is removed from play.
*   If the Summon of this card is negated with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment" you do not get its effect.
*   If you control your opponent’s "Sangan" and it is destroyed, your opponent gets the effect since it activates in his/her Graveyard.
*   You can chain to "Sangan"’s effect.

#### SASUKE SAMURAI

Individual Card Rulings:

*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, apply its effect after entering the Damage Step, but before flipping up the face-down monster. The monster is not flipped. Flip Effects are not activated. Monsters like "Kisetai" and "Giant Axe Mummy" do not activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, there is no damage calculation. "Sasuke Samurai" destroys the monster before damage calculation is reached.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" destroys a face-down monster using its effect, the face-down monster is NOT "destroyed as a result of battle", it is destroyed by "Sasuke Samurai"’s effect. So "Mystic Tomato", "Helpoemer", etc. will not activate their effects. However, monsters like "Sangan" will still activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, and "Ceasefire" is activated during the Battle Step to flip it face-up, "Sasuke Samurai" does not destroy it with its effect and damage calculation is applied normally. The monster must be face-down at the beginning of the Damage Step in order for "Sasuke Samurai" to activate its effect.

#### SASUKE SAMURAI #2

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only activate "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect during your Main Phase 1 or 2 because it's an Ignition Effect.
*   You can only activate "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect once per turn.
*   The effect of "Sasuke Samurai #2" stops in the End Phase, and after the effect ends, you can activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards during the remainder of the End Phase.
*   While "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect is active, you can't activate the effects of cards that activate in the Graveyard like "Black Pendant" and "Statue of the Wicked".
*   You cannot activate the effects of Continuous cards like "Skull Lair", "Ultimate Offering", or "Mass Driver" while "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect is active.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Spell and Trap effects may be activated in a chain to “Sasuke Samurai #2’s” effect.

#### SASUKE SAMURAI #4

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You activate the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. A monster destroyed by the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" is not destroyed as a result of battle. There is no damage calculation. It is not flipped face-up. Any Flip Effects it has are not activated.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai #4" attacks a face-up Attack Position "Reflect Bounder", the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" is resolved before the effect of "Reflect Bounder".

#### SCAPEGOAT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only activate "Scapegoat" if you have 4 or more vacant Monster Card Zones.
*   If the effect of "Cyber Jar" is activated during the turn you already activated "Scapegoat" all monsters that could be Special Summoned will be sent to the Graveyard.
*   If your opponent chains "Magic Jammer" to your "Scapegoat" you may still perform Summons that turn, but if they chain "Imperial Order" you may not perform Summons.
*   You may offer Sheep Tokens as Tributes for Toon Monsters, since they are Special Summoned and not Tribute Summoned.
*   If the effect of "Royal Oppression" is chained to your "Scapegoat" your Sheep Tokens will not be Special Summoned and you still cannot perform any Summons that turn.
*   If you have already Summoned a monster, including a Special Summon caused by the effect of your opponent’s "Cyber Jar" you cannot activate "Scapegoat".
*   You can Set a monster in the same turn you activate "Scapegoat".
*   If you control 2 monsters and your opponent activates "Change of Heart" to gain control of one and you later activate "Scapegoat" your monster will be destroyed during the End Phase if all 5 of your Monster Card Zones are still occupied.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" and your opponent chains "Imperial Order" you can chain "Scapegoat" and "Royal Decree" but only "Scapegoat" will resolve since "Scapegoat" will prevent any Special Summons, and therefore "Monster Reborn" cannot resolve.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters may not be Summoned by the player before or after “Scapegoat’s” resolution.
*   If the activation of “Scapegoat” is negated, the player may Summon a monster.
*   Monsters may be Set before or after the resolution of “Scapegoat.”
*   If a monster would be forced to be summoned after the resolution of “Scapegoat,” that monster will be sent to the Graveyard instead.
*   Sheep Tokens may be Tributed for any purpose other than a Tribute Summon per the text of “Scapegoat.”

#### SCROLL OF BEWITCHMENT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you switch the target of this card with "Collected Power" or "Tailor of the Fickle" you do not select a new Attribute. The newly equipped monster becomes the Attribute that was originally selected when "Scroll of Bewitchment" was activated, even if it is the same as the monster’s original Attribute.

#### SECOND COIN TOSS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this card only applies when you perform a coin toss, not when your opponent performs a coin toss.
*   If an effect requires multiple coin flips, like "Barrel Dragon", you would redo all 3 coin flips.
*   Even if multiple "Second Coin Toss" cards are active, you can only redo each coin toss once.
*   Even if the original coin toss came out in your favor, you may use the effect of "Second Coin Toss" and redo the toss.

#### SECOND GOBLIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of changing a monster's Battle Position can only be used once per turn.

Netrep Rulings:

*   A “Giant Orc” equipped with “Second Goblin” may be changed to attack position after being changed to defense position through its effect, as long as “Second Goblin’s” effect has not been used.

#### SECRET BARREL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Secret Barrel" and your opponent activates something as a chain, the chained card is included in the number (so if your opponent's only card on the field or in his hand is "Mystical Space Typhoon", and he chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "Secret Barrel", he still takes 200 damage).
*   Monster Tokens are counted for "Secret Barrel".

#### SECRET PASS TO THE TREASURES

Individual Card FAQs:

*   There is no way to have a monster with an ATK above 1000 attack directly using the effect of "Secret Pass to the Treasures". When you target a monster with "Secret Pass to the Treasures", and the monster’s ATK is increased above 1000 afterwards, the monster cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly.
*   If the monster attacks your opponent’s Life Points directly, you cannot use an effect such as "Rush Recklessly" to increase its ATK above 1000 during the attack. If a monster attacks directly using the effect of "Secret Pass to the Treasures", "automatic" increases will not apply ("Super Robolady", etc.). If you use "Secret Pass to the Treasures" on "Injection Fairy Lily", and attack directly, you cannot activate the effect of "Injection Fairy Lily".
*   You cannot activate "Secret Pass to the Treasures" during Main Phase 2 or on the very first turn.
*   This card targets a monster.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters able to attack more than once in a turn may attack directly each time from the effect of “Secret Pass to the Treasures” as long as the ATK of the monster does not rise above 1000.

#### SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Self-Destruction Button", and an effect is chained so that the different in Life Points is less than 7000, "Self-Destruction Button" still resolves because its conditions were correct at the time of activation.

#### SENRI EYE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot use "Senri Eye"'s effect more than once during the same Standby Phase.
*   You can use the effect of "Senri Eye" if the top card on the Deck is face-up (due to "Convulsion of Nature" or "Parasite Paracide"), and in that case you don't hide the card from your opponent.

#### SERIAL SPELL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Serial Spell" must be chained to the activation of your Normal Spell Card. Nothing can be chained in-between by yourself or your opponent. If your opponent chains to your Normal Spell Card, you cannot chain "Serial Spell" to that Normal Spell Card. Because of this, it is impossible to chain 2 copies of "Serial Spell" to the same Normal Spell Card.
*   "Serial Spell" does not target a card.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to a Normal Spell Card that targets a card(s) you can select a different target(s) for the "Serial Spell" copy of the Normal Spell Card.
*   Discarding your hand is a cost to activate "Serial Spell". You cannot activate "Serial Spell" if it is the only card in your hand, or if it is Set and you have no cards in your hand.
*   "Serial Spell" only copies the effects of your Normal Spell Card, not any costs of that Spell Card. So if you chain "Serial Spell" to "Delinquent Duo" you do not pay an additional 1000 Life Points.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn", and chain "Serial Spell", discarding your entire hand, you can select and revive one of the monsters you discarded for the cost of "Serial Spell" to be the monster that "Serial Spell" Special Summons to the field. (For example, if you target "Dark Magician" with "Monster Reborn", then chain "Serial Spell" and discard "Buster Blader", you can use "Serial Spell" to Special Summon the "Buster Blader" you discarded to activate "Serial Spell".)
*   You cannot level up "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" from 4 to 8 with just "Level Up!" and "Serial Spell". Because you would send "LV4" to the Graveyard for "Level Up!", but even if you copy it with "Serial Spell", the first "Level Up!" hasn't resolved, so "LV6" isn't on the field to send to the Graveyard as a cost for the copy of "Level Up!" If you have "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" and "Armed Dragon LV3" on the field, and send one of them to the Graveyard with "Level Up!", you cannot use "Serial Spell" to Level Up the other monster, since there was no monster sent to the Graveyard as a cost for "Serial Spell", and "Serial Spell" would have no point of reference to resolve its effect.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Swords of Revealing Light" it will copy the effect of flipping all monsters face-up, but it will not remain on the field and prevent the opponent from attacking. This is because it is a Quick-Play Spell Card and is sent to the Graveyard after the chain resolves.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Different Dimension Capsule" it will copy the effect and remove 1 card you select in your Deck from play, face-down. But because "Serial Spell" does not remain on the field, the selected card remains removed from play face-down and is not placed in your hand.
*   You can activate "Serial Spell" to copy the effect of a Normal Spell Card, even if it is "Raigeki" or "Soul Exchange" and copying the effect serves no real purpose.
*   If you have 2 monsters in your Graveyard, and your opponent only has 1 monster in their Graveyard, you can activate "The Shallow Grave" and chain "Serial Spell", even though you would not normally be able to activate a second "The Shallow Grave" because your monster would no longer have any monsters in the Graveyard. As a result, you will Special Summon 2 monsters and your opponent will only Special Summon 1 monster.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Bait Doll", the entire effect of "Bait Doll" is applied and "Serial Spell" is also shuffled back into your Deck.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Dragged Down into the Grave", the player who activated "Serial Spell" has no cards in hand, so the effect of "Dragged Down into the Grave" is impossible to resolve, and the effect disappears.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Metamorphosis", there is no effect because you did not Tribute a monster for a cost, so "Serial Spell" has no point of reference and cannot resolve.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Monster Gate" resolve the effect of "Monster Gate" twice (once for "Serial Spell" and once for "Monster Gate") even though you only pay the cost once (for "Monster Gate").

#### SERPENTINE PRINCESS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Serpentine Princess" is returned to the Deck by an effect occurring in a chain, the effect of "Serpentine Princess" starts a new Chain after the current Chain resolves completely.
*   If the effect of "Fiber Jar" places "Serpentine Princess" from the field into your Deck, the effect of "Serpentine Princess" is activated and will be applied after the effect of "Fiber Jar" has finished resolving.

#### SEVEN TOOLS OF THE BANDIT

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Seven Tools of the Bandit” may not be activated in a chain to the use of an effect of a continuous Trap that has already been activated, like “Ultimate Offering.”

#### SHADOWSLAYER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   For "Shadowslayer" (unlike cards like "Black Tyranno" and "Drillago"), only the Monster Card Zones are looked at. If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position, then "Shadowslayer" can attack directly even if your opponent has Spell and Trap Cards on the field.
*   If "Shadowslayer" attacks a face-up Attack Position monster, and the opponent activates "Book of Moon" so that his only monster on the field is now in Defense Position, a replay occurs, because "Shadowslayer" is now able to attack directly.
*   If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position but one of them is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", "Shadowslayer" cannot attack directly and must attack that monster if it attacks.

#### SHADOW SPELL

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Shadow Spell” is negated or leaves the field, the targeted monster is not affected by the effect of “Shadow Spell.”

#### SHIELD & SWORD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card only switches the original ATK and DEF. All modifiers are then applied (or re-applied, as appropriate) to the new ATK and DEF.

#### SHIEN'S SPY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you use “Shien’s Spy” on “Silent Swordsman LV5”, it returns to your control during the End Phase as normal.
*   If you chain “Book of Moon” to “Shien’s Spy” to flip the target face-down, the monster still switches to the opponent and returns in the End Phase as normal.
*   If a monster switches sides because of “Shien’s Spy” and is then flipped face-down, it still returns in the End Phase as normal.
*   When a monster returns to the controller during the End Phase for the effect of “Shien’s Spy”, this is not an effect that can be chained to.

#### SHIFTING SHADOWS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have only 1 face-down Defense Position monster you cannot activate the effect of "Shifting Shadows".
*   If you control a monster that is targeted by your opponent's "Nightmare Wheel", and you flip it face-down with "Book of Moon", and control at least 1 other face-down Defense Position monster, you can activate the effect of “Shifting Shadows”. However, afterwards you must tell your opponent which monster is targeted by “Nightmare Wheel”.

#### SHINATO, KING OF A HIGHER PLANE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys "Gradius' Option" or "Maju Garzett", your opponent takes no damage from "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   If "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is destroyed before monsters are sent to the Graveyard, for example if removed from play by "D. D. Warrior Lady", his effect does not activate. But if "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" attacks "Yomi Ship", "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts the damage from his effect even though he will be destroyed by "Yomi Ship"'s effect after "Yomi Ship" is sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys a Defense Position monster, your opponent can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" as a chain to "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush" and destroys your opponent's Defense Position monster, first, during damage calculation, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent's Life Points because of "Fairy Meteor Crush", and then, when the Defense Position monster is sent to the Graveyard, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect inflicts damage equal to the original ATK of the destroyed monster.

#### SHINING ANGEL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you attack with your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Shining Angel" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Shining Angel" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

#### SHOOTING STAR BOW - CEAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" decreases the current ATK. So if "Injection Fairy Lily" is equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and activates her effect, her ATK is 2400 ((400 - 1000) + 3000 = 2400).
*   If a monster equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" declares a direct attack, and "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" is removed from the monster during the Battle Step with "Mystical Space Typhoon" or "Tailor of the Fickle", the monster is no longer capable of attacking directly and a replay occurs.
*   "Tyrant Dragon" must attack a monster in order to gain its second attack, so if it is equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and attacks directly, it cannot get a second attack. But "Tyrant Dragon" equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" can attack a monster, and then attack directly.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Would equipping “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” on a fusion summoned with Magical Scientist allow it to attack directly? A: A monster that is Special Summoned via “Magical Scientist's” effect... cannot attack the opponent directly. Even equipping the Fusion monster with “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” won't change that condition. Steve Okegawa, 12/18/2003

#### SILENT SWORDSMAN LV3

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Silent Swordsman LV3" will negate the effects of your opponent’s Spell Cards that target it, whether that Spell Card targets just "Silent Swordsman LV3" (such as "Soul Exchange") or multiple monsters ("Different Dimension Gate").

#### SILENT SWORDSMAN LV5

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Just like “The Legendary Fisherman” and other monsters that are unaffected by Spell Cards, “Silent Swordsman LV5” can attack normally if your opponent has “Swords of Revealing Light” on the field, and its controller is unaffected by effects like “Toll” and “Gravekeeper’s Servant” when “Silent Swordsman LV5” attacks.
*   If you control “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” and “Silent Swordsman LV5”, and your opponent activates “Fissure”, the monster with the lowest ATK is “Silent Swordsman LV5”, but it is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of “Fissure” disappears.
*   “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected by Spell Cards your opponent controls, including those in your opponent’s hand due to “Exchange” or “Graverobber”.
*   You can Special Summon “Silent Swordsman LV5” with “Autonomous Action Unit”. If “Autonomous Action Unit” is removed from the field, “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected and remains on the field.

#### SINISTER SERPENT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this card is optional; you do not have to return it to your hand.
*   The effect of this card activates no matter how it is sent to the Graveyard. It can be destroyed, Tributed, discarded from the hand, or sent straight from the Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If your "Sinister Serpent" is on the field and is destroyed during your Standby Phase, you may return it to your hand during that same Standby Phase.
*   If "Sinister Serpent" is destroyed as a result of battle with "Dark Ruler Ha Des" or "Dark Balter the Terrible" you cannot activate its effect and return it to your hand during your next Standby Phase, or any subsequent Standby Phase.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "Sinister Serpent" if "The End of Anubis" is on the field.
*   "Necrovalley" does not negate the effect of "Sinister Serpent".

#### SKILL DRAIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.
*   "Skill Drain" negates the effects of face-up Effect Monsters on the field, but does not negate effects that activate in the Graveyard, such as "Witch of the Black Forest", "Sangan", "Mystic Tomato", "Giant Rat", "Exiled Force", "Sinister Serpent", and "Vampire Lord".
*   If your "Dark Flare Knight" is sent to the Graveyard while "Skill Drain" is active, its effect activates in the Graveyard so you can Special Summon "Mirage Knight" (but "Mirage Knight"'s effects will be negated once it is in play).
*   If your "Neko Mane King" is sent to the Graveyard by your opponent's card effect while "Skill Drain" is active, its effect is activated.
*   If your "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while "Skill Drain" is active, its effect activates and it is Special Summoned.
*   “Skill Drain” will not negate an Ignition Effect or Trigger Effect if the Effect Monster is not face-up on the field when the effect resolves.
*   "Skill Drain" does not stop you from activating Ignition Effects, but it does negate their effects as long as the Effect Monster remains on the field. If you Tribute "Cannon Soldier" to itself while "Skill Drain" is active, "Cannon Soldier"'s effect is not negated because "Cannon Soldier" is in the Graveyard, but if you Tribute a different monster for "Cannon Soldier"'s effect, then the effect is negated and your opponent takes no damage. Likewise, if you activate "Winged Minion"'s effect while "Skill Drain" is active, "Winged Minion" is no longer on the field and its effect resolves. If you activate "Exiled Force"'s effect while "Skill Drain" is active, "Exiled Force" is no longer on the field and you can select and destroy 1 monster on the field. If you Tribute "Paladin of White Dragon" to activate its effect while "Skill Drain" is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". If you Tribute "Great Dezard" while "Skill Drain" is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon "Fushioh Richie".
*   "Skill Drain" will negate Flip Effects, and you can chain the activation of "Skill Drain" to the activation of a Flip Effect, but you cannot activate "Skill Drain" in the Damage Step because it does not specifically modify ATK or DEF, so you cannot chain "Skill Drain" to a Flip Effect that is activated because a monster was attacked while face-down.
*   If you Flip Summon "Spear Cretin" while "Skill Drain" is active, "Spear Cretin"'s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and "Skill Drain" negates Flip Effects.
*   "Skill Drain" negates Multi-Trigger Effects such as "Dark Paladin" and "Ryu Senshi".
*   While "Skill Drain" is active you cannot Tribute a face-up "Kaiser Seahorse" to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher LIGHT monster. However, you can Tribute a face-down "Kaiser Seahorse".
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, "maintenance costs" are not negated (see the Advanced Gameplay FAQ) so you still have to pay for "The Unfriendly Amazon", "Armor Exe", Archfiends, etc. However, all other costs are negated, so you do not have to pay to attack with "Dark Elf" or "Jirai Gumo".
*   Restrictions are also lifted, so you can attack with "Ultimate Obedient Fiend" even if you have other cards on your side of the field.
*   Spirit Monsters are not returned to the owner's hand while "Skill Drain" is active.
*   Toon Monsters' effects are negated while "Skill Drain" is active and the Toon Monster is on the field, so they can attack the same turn they are Summoned, you do not have to pay 500 Life Points to attack with them, and they are not destroyed if "Toon World" is destroyed, but they cannot attack your opponent directly.
*   "Jinzo" cannot negate Trap Cards while "Skill Drain" is already active, because "Skill Drain" is negating "Jinzo"'s effect. But if "Jinzo" is already on the field, you cannot activate "Skill Drain" because "Jinzo"'s effect prevents you from doing so.
*   When a monster's ATK or DEF are changed by its own effect, like "Slate Warrior" or "Berserk Dragon", and "Skill Drain" is activated, that monster's effect is negated and the ATK/DEF are returned to normal. Even if "Skill Drain" is then destroyed, the old adjustment to ATK/DEF does not come back. Any bonuses or penalties are lost when "Skill Drain" effect is applied, and you have to start over from the beginning.
*   If your opponent uses "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s effect to increase its ATK, and you use "Skill Drain", "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s ATK returns to normal, even if "Skill Drain" is destroyed after resolving. If "Skill Drain" is negating "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s effect, you can still pay the cost and remove monsters in your Graveyard from play, but "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s ATK will not increase.
*   "Goblin Attack Force" and "Spear Dragon" do not change their battle position after attacking while "Skill Drain" is active. If "Goblin Attack Force" attacks and changes battle position, then on your next turn you activate "Skill Drain", you can change "Goblin Attack Force" back to Attack Position because its effect that prevents this is negated.
*   Monsters equipped to "Relinquished" while "Skill Drain" is active are negated and destroyed because "Relinquished" no longer has an effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and "Relinquished"'s ATK and DEF are returned to normal.
*   Monsters that can hold Spell Counters, like "Skilled Dark Magician", no longer have that effect while "Skill Drain" is active, so they cannot gain more Spell Counters and all Spell Counters already placed on them are removed.
*   If a face-down "Kisetai" is attacked while "Skill Drain" is active, the effect of "Kisetai" is negated, damage calculation is performed, and "Kisetai" will not equip itself to the attacking monster. But if "Kisetai" is already an Equip Spell Card, and "Skill Drain" is activated, Kisetai is unaffected because it is no longer an Effect Monster.
*   The effects of "Zombyra the Dark" are negated while "Skill Drain" is active, so "Zombyra the Dark" can attack your opponent directly, and its ATK is not decreased because of its effect. If "Skill Drain" is destroyed, "Zombyra the Dark"'s ATK is not changed.
*   The ATK and DEF of "Gradius' Option", the ATK of "Maju Garzett", and similar monsters is 0 while "Skill Drain" is active, and is not restored even if "Skill Drain" is destroyed.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after "Hayabusa Knight"'s first attack, "Hayabusa Knight" does not get its second attack.
*   You can Special Summon "Gilasaurus" while "Skill Drain" is active, but its effect is negated so your opponent does not get to Special Summon.
*   Do not roll dice for Archfiends while "Skill Drain" is active.
*   A Union Monster that attached itself to another monster before "Skill Drain" became active is unaffected by "Skill Drain". If "Skill Drain" is active, you can activate a Union Monster's effect to attach it to another monster, but nothing happens and it remains a monster.
*   "Skill Drain" will not affect lingering effects or conditions that are left over from a previous effect. For example, if you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with "Summoner of Illusions", and then "Skill Drain" is activated afterwards, the Fusion Monster is still destroyed in the End Phase. If you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with "Magical Scientist", and then "Skill Drain" is activated, the Fusion Monster cannot attack your opponent's Life Points directly, and is returned to the Fusion Deck at the end of the turn.
*   When "Jowls of Dark Demise"'s effect is activated and resolves, and then "Skill Drain" is activated afterwards, it has no effect on "Jowls of Dark Demise"'s effect, so control of the monster does not change until it is returned to the original controller at the end of the turn.
*   If "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi"'s effect is activated, and then "Skill Drain" is activated later, "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi"'s effect is not negated and the opponent must discard his/her hand during their next Draw Phase. But if "Skill Drain" is active at the time "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi"'s effect activates, then the effect is negated.
*   Conditions for Summoning monsters is not negated by "Skill Drain", so you still must remove 1 DARK and 1 LIGHT monster to Special Summon "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", and you cannot Normal Summon or Flip Summoning "Terrorking Archfiend" if there are no Archfiends on the field.
*   You can have 2 "Gravekeeper's Chiefs" on the field while "Skill Drain" is active, but if "Skill Drain" is destroyed, select 1 of the "Gravekeeper's Chiefs" and destroy it.

#### SKILLED DARK MAGICIAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You place a Spell Counter on this monster when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Skilled Dark Magician, "Skilled Dark Magician" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Skilled Dark Magician" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.
*   You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.
*   When you use the effect of a Continuous Spell Card that is already face-up on the field, such as "Inspection", or sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard, or paying for "Messenger of Peace", you do NOT place a Spell Counter on this monster.
*   When "Double Spell" is played, you get a Spell Counter on this monster for the activation of "Double Spell", but not for the target of "Double Spell" because the target is never activated; so you get 1 Spell Counter on this monster.
*   You do not place a Spell Counter on this monster when you attach or detach a Union Monster because that is not the activation of a Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" to revive this monster, this monster does not get a Spell Counter for "Monster Reborn" (it has to be face-up on the field before the activation of the Spell Card).
*   You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.
*   This monster's effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon "Dark Magician" from your Graveyard and your opponent chains "Disappear" and removes that "Dark Magician", you can Special Summon a different "Dark Magician" from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.
*   If there is no "Dark Magician" in your hand/Deck/Graveyard you can still activate this effect but your opponent can verify the contents to make certain, and then the effect disappears.
*   When "Skill Drain" is active, and you or your opponent activates a Spell Card, do not place Spell Counters on this monster. Any Spell Counters that are on this monster are removed when "Skill Drain" is activated.
*   If a player controls the opponent's "Skilled Dark Magician" and Tribute it with 3 Spell Counters, the player who controlled and Tributed the "Skilled Dark Magician" is the player who Special Summons "Dark Magician" from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

#### SKILLED WHITE MAGICIAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You place a Spell Counter on this monster when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Skilled White Magician", "Skilled White Magician" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Skilled White Magician" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.
*   You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.
*   When you use the effect of a Continuous Spell Card that is already face-up on the field, such as "Inspection", or sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard, or paying for "Messenger of Peace", you do NOT place a Spell Counter on this monster.
*   When "Double Spell" is played, you get a Spell Counter on this monster for the activation of "Double Spell", but not for the target of "Double Spell" because the target is never activated; so you get 1 Spell Counter on this monster.
*   You do not place a Spell Counter on this monster when you attach or detach a Union Monster because that is not the activation of a Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" to revive this monster, this monster does not get a Spell Counter for "Monster Reborn" (it has to be face-up on the field before the activation of the Spell Card).
*   You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.
*   This monster's effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon "Buster Blader" from your Graveyard and your opponent chains "Disappear" and removes that "Buster Blader", you can Special Summon a different "Buster Blader" from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.
*   If there is no "Buster Blader" in your hand/Deck/Graveyard you can still activate this effect but your opponent can verify the contents to make certain, and then the effect disappears.
*   When "Skill Drain" is active, and you or your opponent activates a Spell Card, do not place Spell Counters on this monster. Any Spell Counters that are on this monster are removed when "Skill Drain" is activated.
*   If a player controls the opponent's "Skilled White Magician" and Tribute it with 3 Spell Counters, the player who controlled and Tributed the "Skilled White Magician" is the player who Special Summons "Buster Blader" from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

#### SKULL ARCHFIEND OF LIGHTNING

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a player does not have enough Life Points to remain above 0 Life Points during the Standby Phase to pay for “Skull Archfiend of Lightning,” “Skull Archfiend of Lightning” is destroyed.
*   The die roll effect of “Skull Archfiend of Lightning” does not apply to a face-down “Skull Archfiend of Lightning.”

#### SKULL KNIGHT #2

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you Tribute Set a high level Fiend-Type monster by Tributing this card, you CAN Special Summon another "Skull Knight #2" from your Deck and you do NOT have to reveal your Set monster to prove it is a Fiend-Type.
*   If you activate "Change of Heart" to control your opponent’s "Skull Knight #2" and Tribute it to Tribute Summon a Fiend-Type monster you can Special Summon a "Skull Knight #2" from your Deck. But if you activate "Soul Exchange" to Tribute a "Skull Knight #2" on your opponent’s side of the field, neither player can activate its effect.
*   If this card is used as a Tribute for a Special Summon, such as a Ritual Summon, the effect of this card is not activated.
*   If the Tribute Summon of a Fiend-Type monster is negated by "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven", the effect of "Skull Knight #2" will not activate.
*   If the opponent chains "Torrential Tribute" to the effect of "Skull Knight #2", all monsters will be destroyed (including the Level 5 or higher Fiend-Type monster that was Tribute Summoned) and then "Skull Knight #2" will be Special Summoned from your Deck. If the opponent waits until the effect of "Skull Knight #2" resolves and another copy is Special Summoned, and then activates "Torrential Tribute" in response to that Summon, all the monsters will be destroyed.

#### SKYSCRAPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The ATK increase of “Skyscraper” is a Continuous Effect and does not start a chain.
*   If “Skyscraper” is on the field and you attack a Defense Position monster with an “Elemental Hero” that has ATK lower than the ATK of the Defense Position monster, the “Elemental Hero” gains +1000 ATK even though it was attacking a Defense Position monster.
*   If your opponent’s monster’s ATK is increased during the damage step, like “Injection Fairy Lily” or “Covering Fire”, your “Elemental Hero” will gain the +1000 ATK for “Skyscraper”.

#### SLATE WARRIOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Blade Knight" destroys a Flip Effect Monster like "Slate Warrior", even that monster’s non-Flip effects are negated. So in this case, "Slate Warrior" does not reduce the ATK and DEF of the "Blade Knight" that destroyed it, because "Blade Knight" negates its effect.
*   "Gorgon’s Eye" cannot negate the effect of "Sangan", "Witch of the Black Forest", or "Sinister Serpent" because they activate in the Graveyard. If a Defense Position "Slate Warrior" is attacked and destroyed, the effect of "Slate Warrior" that lowers ATK and DEF is applied because it activates in the Graveyard.
*   If "Grave Protector" is on the field, the effect of "Slate Warrior" that reduces the ATK and DEF of the monster that destroys "Slate Warrior" is still applied, even though "Slate Warrior" is shuffled back into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard. The timing of "Slate Warrior’s" effect is still at the end of the Damage Step (when monsters are normally sent to the Graveyard after battle).
*   When a monster's ATK or DEF are changed by its own effect, like "Slate Warrior" or "Berserk Dragon", and "Skill Drain" is activated, that monster's effect is negated and the ATK/DEF are returned to normal. Even if "Skill Drain" is then destroyed, the old adjustment to ATK/DEF does not come back. Any bonuses or penalties are lost when "Skill Drain" effect is applied, and you have to start over from the beginning.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Slate Warrior” is flipped as a result of battle, “Slate Warrior’s” ATK and DEF bonus will resolve after Damage Calculation.
*   “Slate Warrior’s” "destroyed in battle" effect is not dependent upon “Slate Warrior” being flipped.

#### SMOKE GRENADE OF THE THIEF

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card must be destroyed directly for its effect to activate, such as with the effects of "Mystical Space Typhoon", "Heavy Storm", or "Gearfried the Iron Knight". Its effect does NOT activate if the monster it is equipped to is destroyed, Tributed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field.
*   If your opponent chains "Magic Jammer", "Magic Drain", etc., to negate and destroy this card, its effect does not activate.
*   If the opponent chains "Dust Tornado" or "Mystical Space Typhoon" to the activation of "Smoke Grenade of the Thief", it is destroyed and its effect is NOT activated. This is because it is an Equip Spell Card, and must be on the field when it resolves for its effect to activate.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active on the field, the effect of "Smoke Grenade of the Thief" is not activated, even if it is destroyed by a card effect.

#### SNATCH STEAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your opponent's monster on your side of the field that you control with "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal" is removed with "Different Dimension Gate", it returns to your side of the field when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed, and then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   If your opponent equips “Snatch Steal” to your “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, the effect of “Snatch Steal” resolves first and control changes. Then the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates and your opponent gets to select which monster is destroyed.
*   If you control your opponent's monster because of "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal", and remove the monster with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", the monster returns to your side of the field, then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   When your opponent activates "Snatch Steal", and you chain "Ojama Trio" to fill up his/her remaining Monster Zones, then there is no room for the stolen monster, and it is destroyed.
*   When "Snatch Steal" is active, the +1000 Life Points effect is applied even if "Remove Brainwashing" has returned control of the monster to the original owner.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If more than one “Snatch Steal” is equipped to the same monster, the later “Snatch Steal” will take precedence for purposes of determining control.
*   If “Snatch Steal” leaves the field, the monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” will return to the control of the previous controller.
*   If the monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” is turned face-down, “Snatch Steal” will be sent to the Graveyard and the monster will remain under the control of the controller of “Snatch Steal.”
*   If a monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” changes control via “Creature Swap,” “Snatch Steal” will remain equipped to the original monster, but control will not shift back. The opponent of the controller of “Snatch Steal” will continue to regain 1000 LP per Standby Phase as long as “Snatch Steal” remains on the field.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a player has all 5 Monster Zone spaces full when their opponent’s “Snatch Steal” is destroyed, what will happen to the monster their opponent was controlling with the destroyed “Snatch Steal”?  
    A: The returning monster would be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/28/2004
*   Q: If I have used “Snatch Steal” on a monster from another turn and activate “Tailor of the Fickle” on “Snatch Steal,” can I steal another monster and keep both, or do I only get one?  
    A: You would keep the new equipped monster. The monster formerly equipped with “Snatch Steal” would return to your opponent's side of the field. Steve Okegawa, 12/14/2003
*   Q: Can “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” be activated to destroy an opponent’s monster if all 5 Monster Zone spaces are full or does it only happen during the resolution of a chain?  
    A: It is during the resolution of a chain. If you do not have any empty zones in your Monster Zone you cannot activate "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal" to take control of an opponent's monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004
*   Q: Say Player A plays “Snatch Steal” on Player B’s “Jinzo”. Then Player B uses “Change of Heart” on “Jinzo” and then “Book of Moon”. What would happen to “Jinzo”?  
    A: During the End Phase “Jinzo” would return to the previous controller. Player A, based on your example. Curtis Schultz, 01/18/2004

#### SOLAR FLARE DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 2 "Solar Flare Dragons", or a "Solar Flare Dragon" equipped with "Raregold Armor" and another Pyro-Type monster, your opponent cannot attack.
*   Even if "Solar Flare Dragon"'s Type is changed, as long as there is another Pyro-Type monster on your side of the field, "Solar Flare Dragon" cannot be attacked.
*   You can apply "Barrel Behind the Door" to the effect of "Solar Flare Dragon".

#### SOLEMN JUDGMENT

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Solemn Judgment” can not be used to negate a Special Summon if that Special Summon occurs as a result of another card effect.
*   Special Summon monsters like “Dark Necrofear” that have their summons negated by “Solemn Judgment” are not considered properly summoned and may not be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a person uses “Solemn Judgment” and the resulting Life Points results in a decimal, what happens? Does it round up or down?  
    A: If equal or more than 0.5, round up. If less than 0.5, round down. bishop, 01/20/2004

#### SOLEMN WISHES

Netrep Rulings:

*   The Life Point gain of Solemn Wishes is per instance of drawing, not per card.

#### SOLOMON'S LAWBOOK

Netrep Rulings:

*   Payments that would occur during the Standby Phase skipped due to “Solomon’s Lawbook” do not occur.

#### SONIC JAMMER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Sonic Jammer" during your turn, it lasts until the end of your opponent's End Phase. If you activate "Sonic Jammer" during your opponent's turn, it lasts until the end of your End Phase.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after "Sonic Jammer"'s effect has resolved, the effect of "Sonic Jammer" is not negated because "Skill Drain" was not active when "Sonic Jammer" was flipped, activated its effect, and applied its effect.
*   While "Sonic Jammer"'s effect is applied, your opponent can still use the effects of "Wave Motion Cannon", or "Black Pendant" when sent to the Graveyard, or Field Spell Cards like "Fusion Gate".
*   While "Sonic Jammer"'s effect is applied, your opponent cannot activate "Spiritualism".

#### SOUL ABSORPTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Soul Absorption"'s effect is based on the number of cards, not on each "lump sum" of cards. So if 3 DARK monsters are removed from the Graveyard to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear", the controller of "Soul Absorption" gains 1500 Life Points.
*   However, you receive the Life Points from "Soul Absorption" as a "lump sum", so in the case of "Dark Necrofear" you gain 1500 Life Points but your "Fire Princess" would only do 500 points of damage.
*   "Soul Absorption" is a "trigger-like" Continuous Spell Card, not a "continuous-like" Continuous Spell Card, so activate its effect after the current chain resolves that includes removing cards from play.
*   The effect of "Soul Absorption" can, itself, be chained to after it activates.
*   If "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates in response to the Special Summon of a monster like "Dark Necrofear" or "Inferno", Soul Absorption's effect activates after the monster is Special Summoned.
*   For "Chaosrider Gustapth", activate "Soul Absorption"'s effect after "Chaosrider Gustaph"'s effect resolves.
*   Your "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates even when your opponent's cards are removed.

#### SOUL DEMOLITION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If either player has no monsters in their Graveyard, the effect of this card cannot be activated.
*   If "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" is on the field, the effect of this card cannot be activated.
*   Paying 500 Life Points is a cost.
*   You must select the monster in the Graveyard you wish to target when you activate this card’s effect. You select before the opponent does. After you select the opponent may chain, with a card like "Dust Tornado", to destroy "Soul Demolition". In this case its effect will not resolve and no monsters will be removed. This is because it is a Continuous Trap Card and it must remain on the field for its effect to resolve. If the effect is negated you do not get a refund of the 500 Life Point cost.
*   If the opponent chains to the effect of "Soul Demolition" with an effect that destroys all the Fiend-Type monsters on your side of the field, the effect of "Soul Demolition" resolves because the activation conditions were correct at the time.
*   If you chain the effect of "Soul Demolition" to "Monster Reborn" and remove the monster targeted by "Monster Reborn" from play, the effect of "Monster Reborn" disappears.

#### SOUL EXCHANGE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "Soul Exchange" during your Main Phase and use its effect to Tribute your opponent’s monster for "Ectoplasmer" during the End Phase.
*   If you activated “Soul Exchange” targeting your opponent’s monster, if the monster is face-down, you cannot Tribute it as a cost for “Metamorphosis”.
*   Since "Soul Exchange" targets, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The player activating “Soul Exchange” must declare a target at the time “Soul Exchange” is activated.
*   If the monster targeted by “Soul Exchange” leaves the field before it is Tributed, that effect of “Soul Exchange” disappears. “Soul Exchange” will still force the player to skip his or her Battle Phase.
*   If the effect of “Soul Exchange” is not used in the turn that “Soul Exchange” has been activated, the effect of “Soul Exchange” disappears.
*   Monsters targeted by “Soul Exchange” may be used for a Ritual Summon.
*   If “Soul Exchange” targets “Spirit Reaper,” “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: When is the monster targeted by “Soul Exchange” Tributed?  
    A: The monster targeted by "Soul Exchange" remains on the field until you actually use it for the Tribute. The monster is not automatically Tributed when "Soul Exchange" resolves. Curtis Schultz, 02/12/2004

#### SOUL RELEASE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Soul Release” is a targeting effect.
*   “Soul Release” may remove any number of cards from the Graveyard from 1 to 5.

#### SOUL REVERSAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Soul Reversal"'s effect targets.

#### SOUL-ABSORBING BONE TOWER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor" and a Zombie-Type monster, your opponent cannot attack. Even if you have a Zombie-Type monster, "Gemini Elf", and a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor", your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have another Zombie-Type monster and "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", your opponent cannot attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", but if you equip the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" with "Ring of Magnetism" your opponent can declare an attack but must attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with the "Ring of Magnetism".
*   If you have multiple "Soul-Absorbing Bone Towers" and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack.
*   When your opponent attacks your "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and during the Battle Step you activate "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon another Zombie-Type monster, then a replay occurs (and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard).
*   If "DNA Surgery" is in play changing all monsters to Zombie-Types, and a monster that was not originally a Zombie-Type is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is applied and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned on your opponent's side of the field, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect activates.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned face-down (with "The Shallow Grave", etc.) then "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect does not activate.
*   If multiple Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is only applied once (so send just 2 cards).
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Special Summoned by itself, its effect is not applied for its own Special Summon.
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and several other Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously (with "Cyber Jar"), that Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower's effect is not applied.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" in play and "The Kick Man" is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is Step 1 of a chain and "The Kick Man"'s effect is Step 2.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and "Card of Safe Return", and a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Step 1 of the chain and "Card of Safe Return" is Step 2.
*   You can chain to "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect that sends 2 cards to the Graveyard.

#### SPARK BLASTER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “Spark Blaster” targets.
*   You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” multiple times in the same Main Phase. You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” during the same turn you played it from your hand.
*   You can chain to “Spark Blaster” when its effect is used. After its effect is used 3 times, you cannot chain to the destruction of “Spark Blaster”.
*   If “Silent Swordsman LV7” is on the field when “Spark Blaster’s” effect is used for the third time, “Spark Blaster” is still destroyed normally.
*   If you chain to the effect of “Spark Blaster” with “Emergency Provisions” and send “Spark Blaster” to your Graveyard, because “Spark Blaster” is no longer on the field its effect disappears.

#### SPATIAL COLLAPSE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Spatial Collapse" is activated, and an effect is chained so that a player has more than 5 cards on the field after "Spatial Collapse" resolves, the controller selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.
*   You can activate "Spatial Collapse" when you have 5 or less cards on the field and your opponent has 5 or less cards on the field.
*   "Spatial Collapse" includes Tokens, too.
*   While "Spatial Collapse" is active and you have 1 or more cards already on your side of the field, you cannot activate "Scapegoat" because you would have your 1 previous card + the "Scapegoat" card + 4 monster tokens = 6.
*   When you have 4 cards on your side of the field while "Spatial Collapse" is active, you cannot activate "Change of Heart".
*   When "Cyber Jar" is activated while "Spatial Collapse" is active, if the number of cards exceeds 5, each player selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.
*   When you have 4 cards on the field and you activate "Remove Brainwashing", you select cards to destroy to make the number of cards you control 5.

Netrep Rulings:

*   While “Spatial Collapse” is active, cards that Special Summon a monster may not be activated if that player’s filled zones are 4.
*   The zones prohibited by “Ground Collapse” do not count toward the affected player’s limit for “Spatial Collapse,” unless a monster already occupies that zone.

#### SPEAR CRETIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Blade Knight" destroys "Spear Cretin", "Spear Cretin"’s effect is not applied.
*   When a card that selects a card in the Graveyard as a target, such as "Monster Reborn", "Mask of Darkness", "Magician of Faith", "Spear Cretin", or "The Shallow Grave", is activated, you may chain "Disappear" to remove the targeted card from play, and the "Monster Reborn", etc., will resolve without effect. This is because these cards select their target at activation, not resolution.
*   If you Flip Summon "Spear Cretin" while "Skill Drain" is active, "Spear Cretin"'s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and "Skill Drain" negates Flip Effects.
*   If "The End of Anubis" is face-up on the field when a flipped "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin's" effect does not activate. But if "The End of Anubis" was merely on the field when "Spear Cretin" was flipped, but is NOT on the field when "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin's" effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because "The End of Anubis" is no longer on the field to negate it.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Spear Cretin’s” effect is optional.
*   A player may not choose the same “Spear Cretin” that was destroyed as a target for its effect.
*   A monster destroyed at the same time as “Spear Cretin” may not be chosen as the Special Summon for the effect of “Spear Cretin.”

#### SPEAR DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Spear Dragon" attacks, even if the damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku" or "Kuriboh", it is still changed to Defense Position.
*   "Spear Dragon" will change to Defense Position after it attacks, regardless of the battle position of the opponent’s monster.
*   The effect of "Spear Dragon" does not prevent you from manually changing its battle position later on. Of course, you cannot change it in the same turn after you attacked with "Spear Dragon". But during your next turn you can change it back to Attack Position (and attack again the same turn, if you choose).
*   If you attack your opponent’s Defense Position monster with 0 DEF with your "Spear Dragon", and have "Dragon’s Rage" active on the field, the opponent only takes 1900 points of damage. The effects are not cumulative.
*   The effect of "Lord of D." will not prevent the effect of "Spear Dragon" from changing it to Defense Position after it attacks.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If the attack of “Spear Dragon” is negated, “Spear Dragon” does not change to defense position.

#### SPECIAL HURRICANE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Special Hurricane" will destroy face-down monsters that were Special Summoned.
*   If a monster is Special Summoned, then removed from the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", and returns to the field, "Special Hurricane" WILL destroy it if activated after it returns to the field.

#### SPELL ABSORPTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Spell Absorption” is applied when the Spell Card is activated. You cannot chain to this effect. The effect is applied immediately. For example, when activating “Tribute to the Doomed” while “Spell Absorption” is on the field: (1) pay the cost by discarding a card, (2) activate “Tribute to the Doomed”, (3) your Life Points increase for “Spell Absorption”, (4) check for chaining and resolve “Tribute to the Doomed”.
*   If the activation of a Spell Card is negated by “Magic Jammer”, etc., then you will not gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption”.
*   A Spell Card used from the Graveyard by the effect of “Double Spell” is not considered “activated”, so you will only gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption” for “Double Spell” itself, not for the card used from the Graveyard.
*   When you activate “Spell Absorption”, you do not gain Life Points for activating “Spell Absorption” itself.

#### SPELL CANCELLER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Spell Canceller"'s effect is similar to "Imperial Order".
*   If "Last Will"'s effect is active (its 'state' is in effect) and "Spell Canceller" is Summoned, "Spell Canceller" will not negate the effect of "Last Will".
*   You can Special Summon "Spell Canceller" with "Premature Burial"; the effect of "Premature Burial" is negated by "Spell Canceller" so if "Premature Burial" is destroyed, "Spell Canceller" is not destroyed and remains on the field.
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to a Spell Card, and Special Summon "Spell Canceller", to negate the effect of the Spell Card.
*   You can activate "Spiritualism" when "Spell Canceller" is face-up on the field because its activation and effect cannot be negated.
*   When "Spell Canceller" is face-up on the field, you can activate the Graveyard effect of "Dark Necrofear" (because it is a monster effect) and equip it to a monster, but the effect of "Dark Necrofear" after it is equipped will be negated because it is then an Equip Spell Card.

#### SPELL ECONOMICS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Spell Economics" is active, you don't have to pay Life Points to activate a Spell Card (place it face-up on the field), but to activate an effect of a Spell Card, like "Archfiend's Oath", you still have to pay.
*   Only the controller of "Spell Economics" gets its effect.
*   You have to pay for "Chain Energy" even if you control "Spell Economics".
*   You pay the 500 Life Points to restore "Horn of Light" to your Deck even if "Spell Economics" is on the field.

#### SPELL SHIELD TYPE-8

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Discarding a Spell Card for "Spell Shield Type-8" is a cost.

#### SPELL VANISHING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you activate "Spell Vanishing", you get to search your opponent's Deck to look for any Spell Cards of the same name as the destroyed Spell Card.

#### SPELLBINDING CIRCLE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Battle Position of a monster targeted by this card can still be changed by card effects, such as "Book of Moon", "Stop Defense", etc.
*   This card may select a face-down monster as a target. This prevents the monster from being Flip Summoned, but it will still be flipped face-up if it is the target of an attack.
*   If the targeted monster is Tributed, changed into an Equip Spell Card by the effect of "Relinquished", returned to the owner’s hand, or otherwise removed from the field without being destroyed, "Spellbinding Circle" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   You can chain "Spellbinding Circle" to the activation of a Flip Effect when a monster is Flip Summoned or flipped face-up, but it will not negate the activation or resolution of the Flip Effect.
*   You can activate "Change of Heart" and take control of a monster targeted by "Spellbinding Circle" but you cannot attack with it or change its Battle Position.
*   If a monster attacks and you activate "Spellbinding Circle", the monster’s attack stops.

#### SPHINX TELEIA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card’s effect which allows you to Special Summon it is a Spell Speed 1 effect that you can only activate during your Main Phase 1 or 2.

#### SPIRAL SPEAR STRIKE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Spiral Spear Strike” that causes you to draw can be chained to. But the first effect is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   If you have 2 copies of “Spiral Spear Strike”, or “Spiral Spear Strike” and a “Gaia the Dragon Champion” equipped with “Fairy Meteor Crush”, the damage to your opponent’s Life Points is not doubled. (In the case of “Fairy Meteor Crush”, you still can draw for the “Spiral Spear Strike” effect.)

#### SPIRIT BARRIER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You still perform damage calculation with "Spirit Barrier" even though the damage to the controller’s Life Points becomes zero.
*   If you have 1 monster on the field, and "Airknight Parshath" attack and destroys it, and would do extra damage, there is still a monster on the field when "Airknight Parshath"’s effect would activate and resolve, so "Spirit Barrier"’s effect is applied, "Airknight Parshath" inflicts zero damage to your Life Points, and your opponent does not draw 1 card for "Airknight Parshath"’s effect.

#### SPIRIT ELIMINATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   During the turn that "Spirit Elimination" is activated; all monsters removed from play must be from your side of the field. This means that you cannot activated "Soul Release" and remove two monsters from your side of the field and three from your Graveyard.
*   Any conditions set on the Monster Cards that would be removed from the Graveyard must still be fulfilled on the Monsters removed from your side of the field. For example, to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear" you must remove 3 Fiend-Type Monsters from your side of the field.
*   You can activate "Spirit Elimination" while "Necrovalley" is active.

#### SPIRIT MESSAGE "A"

Netrep Rulings:

*   Spirit Messages may not be placed on the field except as a result of the effect of “Destiny Board.”
*   The placement of Spirit Messages cannot be negated.

#### SPIRIT MONSTERS

The following rules apply to all Spirit Monsters:

*   Spirit is not a monster Type; you cannot declare "Spirit" for the effect of "DNA Surgery".
*   Spirit Monsters are still Effect Monsters.
*   A Spirit Monster must be face-up on the field during the End Phase for it to return to the owner’s hand. If it was destroyed or removed from play, it will not return to the owner’s hand.
*   A Spirit Monster will return to the owner’s hand during the End Phase, even if the opponent played it from their hand (through the effect of "Exchange".)

#### SPIRIT OF THE PHARAOH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Spirit of the Pharaoh" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "The First Sarcophagus". So "Spirit of the Pharaoh" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   If your opponent chains "Royal Decree" to the effect of "The First Sarcophagus", the effect of Special Summoning is negated and "The First Sarcophagus" is sent to the Graveyard because that is the cost.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is in play and you activate "The First Sarcophagus", you cannot Special Summon "Spirit of the Pharaoh".
*   You select the Zombie-Type monsters when you successfully Special Summon "Spirit of the Pharaoh", then activate his effect.
*   "Spirit of the Pharaoh"'s effect targets.
*   You can choose whether or not to activate "Spirit of the Pharaoh"'s effect, but if you activate it you must Special Summon at least 1 Zombie-Type monster.
*   If you have "Stumbling" on the field and "Spirit of the Pharaoh" is Special Summoned, his effect can be activated but it is a chain with "Stumbling" as Step 1 and "Spirit of the Pharaoh" as Step 2.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster had its Level reduced by "Cost Down", that reduction no longer applies when it is in the Graveyard.
*   If you activate "Spirit of the Pharaoh"'s effect and "Enemy Controller" is chained, and control of "Spirit of the Pharaoh" switches, the effect is still controlled by the activator of "Spirit of the Pharoah"'s effect.

#### SPIRIT OF THE POT OF GREED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect does not chain to "Pot of Greed"; instead, you activate it after "Pot of Greed" resolves.
*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed" must be face-up on the field to resolve its effect; if "Book of Moon" is chained to "Pot of Greed" or to the effect of "Spirit of the Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect is negated.
*   If "Imperial Order" negates the effect of "Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect still activates because "Pot of Greed"'s activation was not negated.

#### SPIRIT REAPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While in Defense Position, "Spirit Reaper" will stop all Battle Damage to your Life Points from most monsters, but monsters like "Spear Dragon" and those equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush" can still inflict Battle Damage to your Life Points with their effects.
*   If attacked while face-down, "Spirit Reaper" flips face-up and its effect preventing it from being destroyed will be applied during damage calculation, so "Spirit Reaper" will not be destroyed by the attack.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is attacked by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", "Spirit Reaper" isn’t destroyed during damage calculation, so the effect of "Dark Ruler Ha Des" does not activate.
*   When "Spirit Reaper" is targeted by an effect, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect AFTER resolving the effect that targeted it. For example, if "Spirit Reaper" attacks and "Magic Cylinder" is activated, designating "Spirit Reaper", first "Magic Cylinder" will resolve, negate the attack, and inflict 300 damage to the controller of "Spirit Reaper". Then, after that, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its effect.
*   "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect after a card that targets it resolves. If a Spell Card targets it, and the activation of that Spell Card is negated (such as with "Magic Jammer"), then "Spirit Reaper" is not destroyed. However, if the effect of the Spell Card was negated, such as if "Imperial Order" is active, then "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed because the Spell Card resolves (even though its effect is negated). Even if "Imperial Order" is already active on the field, you can activate a card such as "Tribute to the Doomed" designating "Spirit Reaper", and "Spirit Reaper" will be destroyed by its own effect.
*   "Spirit Reaper" is only destroyed by its own effect if it is face-up on the field when the effect designating it as a target activates, AND after the effect designating it as a target resolves. If you Special Summon "Spirit Reaper" with Monster Reborn, or flip it face-down with "Book of Moon", or flip it face-up with "Book of Taiyou", it is not destroyed. If a face-down "Spirit Reaper" is targeted with "Change of Heart", then Flip Summoned, it is not destroyed because it was face-down when "Change of Heart" was activated. If "Spirit Reaper" is targeted by the effect of "Relinquished", "Spirit Reaper" is an Equip Spell Card after the effect of "Relinquished" resolves, so it is not destroyed. If "Spirit Reaper" is removed from play with "Dimensionhole" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Different Dimension Gate", then it is removed from play so it is not destroyed. If "Spirit Reaper" is shuffled into the Deck with "Monster Recovery", it’s not destroyed. If "Spirit Reaper" is returned to the hand with "Penguin Soldier", it’s not destroyed.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its effect during the Damage Step, such as if "Rush Recklessly" was activated to increase its ATK, destroy "Spirit Reaper" with its effect AFTER damage calculation.
*   "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed if equipped, including with "Heart of Clear Water".
*   Examples of cards that will not destroy "Spirit Reaper" because they do not target: "Creature Swap", "Adhesion Trap Hole", "Spear Dragon".
*   Since "Soul Exchange" targets, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.
*   "Spirit Reaper" has a special effect for when it isn’t destroyed (as a result of battle), and a special effect for an extra reason to destroy it (when targeted by an effect). But it can still be destroyed by all other normal effects that would destroy a monster: "Cyber Jar", "Raigeki", etc.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is Special Summoned with "Premature Burial" or "Call of the Haunted", "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed after it is Special Summoned because it is targeted by an effect.
*   "Spirit Reaper" only forces your opponent to discard when "Spirit Reaper" attacks directly (such as when your opponent has no monsters on the field), AND when it inflicts at least 1 point of damage to the opponent’s Life Points. So if your opponent uses "Kuriboh", "Waboku", or "Tornado Wall" to prevent the damage, "Spirit Reaper" does not force the opponent to discard.
*   "Dreamsprite" targets 1 of your own monsters. If "Spirit Reaper" is targeted, it is destroyed after damage calculation.
*   "Patrician of Darkness" does not target, so "Spirit Reaper" is not destroyed if you use "Patrician of Darkness" to force your opponent to attack it.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is targeted by "Riryoku", it is destroyed, but the increase to the other monster’s ATK lasts until the end of the turn as normal.
*   If a Spellcaster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Spirit Reaper", it’s just a normal attack. "Spirit Reaper" is not being targeted by "Diffusion Wave-Motion".
*   If "Skill Drain" is active, "Spirit Reaper" can be equiped with Equip Cards, but if "Skill Drain" is later removed from the field "Spirit Reaper" wil be destroyed.
*   "Spirit Reaper" can be destroyed as a result of battle while "Skill Drain" is active.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by a card during the Damage Step, Damage Calculation resolves as normal and then “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect.
*   If “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” attacks and targets “Spirit Reaper” with its effect, “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect and a replay will occur.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Bob activates Snatch Steal targeting Spirit Reaper. Andrew chains Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy Snatch Steal. Does Spirit Reaper still destroy itself?  
    A: "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed after the card that targets it resolves. "Snatch Steal" is an Equip Card. Since "Snatch Steal" was destroyed before it could resolve, it's effect disappears and does not resolve. Since "Snatch Steal" doesn't resolve, "Spirit Reaper" is not destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 11/09/2005

#### SPIRIT RYU

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Spirit Ryu’s” effect is considered Spell Speed 1, but may be activated multiple times in the same Battle Phase.

Other Rulings:

*   "Spirit Ryu's" effect can only be activated in the Battle Step. This is where the attack is declared. Because you can activate multiple chains during this step, as long as you have Dragons in your hand, you can discard them 1 at a time to keep \[using\] "Spirit Ryu's" effect. You can't discard, say, 4 in one shot. 1 at a time and your opponent gets the chance to respond/chain. Andrew Roth, 6/21/2005

#### SPIRIT'S INVITATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can choose not to pay 500 Life Points during your Standby Phase, and destroy this card instead.
*   The effect of this card is applied even when a Spirit Monster is returned to its owner’s hand by the effect of another card, such as "Penguin Soldier".

#### SPIRITUAL EARTH ART - KUROGANE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Tributing a monster is a cost for “Spiritual Earth Art – Kurogane”.
*   You can Tribute a face-down EARTH monster for the cost of “Spiritual Earth Art – Kurogane”.
*   “Spiritual Earth Art – Kurogane” is an effect that targets 1 monster in your Graveyard. (So it will be negated by “Necrovalley” or “The End of Anubis”).

#### SPIRITUAL ENERGY SETTLE MACHINE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When this card is active, Spirit Monsters on both sides of the field do not return to their owner’s hand during the End Phase of the turn they were Summoned.
*   Discarding 1 card during your End Phase is a maintenance cost and must be paid each turn. You may decide to not discard a card, and destroy this card instead.
*   When this card is active, Spirit Monsters may still be returned to their owner’s hands by card effects such as "Penguin Soldier" and "Compulsory Evacuation Device".

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Spiritual Energy Settle Machine” is negated, Spirits summoned that turn will return to the hand as normal. Spirits summoned or turned face up on previous turns will not return to the hand

#### SPIRITUAL WIND ART - MIYABI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “Spiritual Wind Art – Miyabi” is an effect that targets.
*   If you target the opponent’s Fusion Monster for “Spiritual Wind Art – Miyabi”, the Fusion Monster is placed on the bottom of the Fusion Deck. (Oh no!)

#### SPIRITUALISM

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Spell or Trap Card goes to its owner’s hand (in case your Spell or Trap Card was on your opponent’s side of the field).

#### SPRING OF REBIRTH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Only the controller of "Spring of Rebirth" gains Life Points by its effect. If you control "Spring of Rebirth", you gain Life Points even when a monster is returned to your opponent’s hand.
*   You gain 500 Life Points each time a monster or monsters on the field are returned to their owner’s hand. So if "Penguin Soldier" returns two monsters at once, you only gain 500 Life Points.
*   Spirit Monsters are sent to the owner’s hand one at a time during the End Phase. So if you have 4 face-up Spirit Monsters during the End Phase, you will gain 500 Life Points for each, totaling 2000 Life Points.
*   Multiple "Spring of Rebirth" cards are cumulative.

#### STAMPING DESTRUCTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you activate this card, if the opponent activates an effect in a chain that destroys the targeted Spell or Trap Card, the opponent will not take the 500 points of damage. If your opponent merely chains the Spell or Trap card that you targeted, the Spell or Trap Card will be destroyed when "Stamping Destruction" resolves and your opponent will take 500 points of damage. (Remember that Spell and Trap Cards remain on the field until the entire chain resolves, unless destroyed by a card effect during the chain.)
*   If your opponent destroys all the Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as a chain to the activation of this card, this card will still resolve since the conditions were met at the time of activation.

#### STATUE OF THE WICKED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card is only activated if sent from the field to the Graveyard. There is no way to activate this card while it is Set on the field.
*   The effect of "Statue of the Wicked" is activated in the Graveyard, so its effect is activated even if "Jinzo" is on the field, because "Jinzo" only applies to Trap Cards and Trap Card effects on the field. Also, cards like "Seven Tools of the Bandit" cannot be used against "Statue of the Wicked".
*   "Statue of the Wicked" activates its effect even if it is destroyed on the same turn it was Set.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is in play, then "Statue of the Wicked" does not activate its effect when destroyed, because it is not sent to the Graveyard.
*   "Statue of the Wicked" activates its effect even if you destroy your own "Statue of the Wicked".
*   You can Tribute a "Wicked Token".

#### STAUNCH DEFENDER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Activating the card causes a replay.
*   Monsters Special Summoned that same turn after activation of "Staunch Defender" must also attack the monster selected by "Staunch Defender".
*   If your monster selected with "Staunch Defender" is destroyed, your opponent's remaining monsters cannot attack.
*   When your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to your "Staunch Defender" to destroy the selected monster, the effect of "Staunch Defender" is negated and battle is conducted normally.
*   While "Staunch Defender" is active, your opponent must still pay costs to attack with "Dark Elf", etc., if he/she attacks with that monster.
*   You cannot select "Guardian Kay'est" or "The Legendary Fisherman" for "Staunch Defender" if they cannot be attacked.
*   You can activate "Staunch Defender" when a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" declares an attack. The monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" will then attack your selected monster once (and only once).
*   When you select "Spirit Reaper" or "The Reaper on the Nightmare" as the target of "Staunch Defender", resolve the chain, and after the effect of "Staunch Defender" resolves, the selected monster is destroyed. A replay will occur, but the opponent can no longer attack because the selected monster is gone.
*   If two "Staunch Defenders" are activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.
*   If "Absolute End" and "Staunch Defender" are both activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters summoned after “Staunch Defender” resolves must attack the designated monster.
*   If the monster designated by “Staunch Defender” is destroyed or leaves the field, the opponent’s monsters may no longer attack.
*   “Staunch Defender” may only designate a legal attack target.
*   Monsters that have attacked before “Staunch Defender” was activated may not attack again, unless that monster was able to attack a second time normally.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” declares an attack and the opponent activates “Staunch Defender”, will all other face-up monsters have to attack?  
    A: It depends on "Thousand Eyes Restrict" surviving the attack. If the "Thousand Eyes Restrict" survives the attack (due to Battle Damage or its effect), then no other monster will be allowed to attack. If it does not survive and is sent to the Graveyard or otherwise removed from the field, then any other face-up monsters on your side of the field would have to attack the selected monster. Curtis Schultz, 02/01/2004

#### STEAMROID

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Steamroid” is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.

#### STONE STATUE OF THE AZTECS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Battle Damage doubled by "Stone Statue of the Aztecs"' effect is still considered Battle Damage (not effect damage).
*   If "Rod of the Mind's Eye" is equipped to "Stone Statue of the Aztecs", the Battle Damage will be 1000.
*   The Battle Damage is doubled during damage calculation.
*   When "Amazoness Swordswoman" (1500 ATK) attacks "Stone Statue of the Aztecs" (2000 DEF), the controller of Stone Statue of the Aztecs takes 1000 Battle Damage.

#### STOP DEFENSE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Using "Stop Defense" on a face-down monster does not constitute a Flip Summon, so "Trap Hole" could not be used.

#### STRAY LAMBS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Stray Lambs" the same turn that you Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon. But you can perform a Set the same turn. So you can activate "Stray Lambs" and then Tribute one of them to Set "Labyrinth Wall".
*   You can't activate "Stray Lambs" unless you have at least 2 vacant Monster Card Zones.

#### STRIKE NINJA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Strike Ninja"'s effect during the Damage Step.
*   "Strike Ninja" is a Multi-Trigger effect so you can chain it to another Spell Speed 1 or 2 effect and can activate it outside your Main Phases, even during your opponent's turn (but not during the Damage Step).
*   You can only activate "Strike Ninja"'s effect when "Strike Ninja" is face-up on the field.
*   Removing 2 DARK monsters for "Strike Ninja"'s effect is a cost.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Strike Ninja” attempts to return to the field when all monster zones are occupied, “Strike Ninja” is destroyed.
*   “Strike Ninja’s” effect only applies while “Strike Ninja” is face up on the field.
*   The effect of “Strike Ninja” returning to the field after being removed by its own effect is not a Special Summon.

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

*   Q: Can "Strike Ninja" return in the End Phase if my monster zones are full from having activated "Return from the Different Dimension" previously this turn?  
    A: Yes. Since both "Strike Ninja" and "Return from the Different Dimension" will resolve in the End Phase you can choose in which order this will happen. You can choose to resolve "Return from the Different Dimension" and then resolve "Strike Ninja". In this instance "Strike Ninja" will return to the field. If you choose to resolve "Strike Ninja" before "Return from the Different Dimension" then it will be sent to the graveyard.

#### STUMBLING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of "Stumbling" goes on a chain immediately after a monster is Summoned. As a mandatory Trigger Effect, "Stumbling" is always on the chain before optional Trigger Effects (“Mobius the Frost Monarch”) or chained Spell & Trap Cards (“Trap Hole”).
*   "Stumbling" changes a monster to face-up Defense Position, not face-down Defense Position.
*   When "Stumbling" and "Final Attack Orders" are both active, a Summoned monster is changed to Defense Position, then changed to Attack Position.
*   If "Stumbling" is in effect and you Summon "Exiled Force", and your opponent has "Trap Hole" Set, "Stumbling" initiates a chain with "Stumbling"'s effect as Step 1. Your opponent can activate "Trap Hole" as Step 2. You cannot chain "Exiled Force" because its effect is Spell Speed 1. Therefore "Trap Hole" will destroy "Exiled Force" before you have a chance to Tribute it.
*   If "Dream Clown" is Summoned while "Stumbling" is active, and changed to Defense Position by "Stumbling"'s effect, "Dream Clown"'s effect activates after "Stumbling"'s effect resolves.

#### SUIJIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   A marker may be placed on this card to indicate that its effect has been used. The effect resets if the monster is destroyed or removed from the field.
*   You can use the effect of this card even if it is face-down when it is attacked because its effect is activated during the Damage Step, and it will be face-up at that point.
*   The effect of this card targets.

#### SUMMONER OF ILLUSIONS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost.
*   You must use "Summoner of Illusions"’ effect when it is flipped face-up, either by Flip Summon or by being attacked. If you have no cards in your Fusion Deck, the effect cannot activate and you do not Tribute 1 monster.
*   If you use "Dimensionhole" on the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect, it will return during your next Standby Phase and not be destroyed.
*   If the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down it will not be destroyed during your End Phase, since the condition is reset when the monster becomes face-down.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Fiend Skull Dragon” is summoned by the effect of “Summoner of Illusions,” that “Fiend Skull Dragon” will immediately negate the effect of “Summoner of Illusions” and will not be destroyed at the end of the turn.

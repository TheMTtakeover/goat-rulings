#### MAGE POWER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Mage Power" includes itself, Field Spell Cards on your side of the field, and monsters acting like Equip Spell Cards, such as Union Monsters.
*   If you control "Cannon Soldier" equipped with "Mage Power", and you activate "Limiter Removal", then the ATK of "Cannon Soldier" is (1400 + 500 + 500) x 2 = 4800.

Netrep Rulings:

*   "Mage Power" counts itself toward its effect. (Example: if you Equip this Spell Card to your monster and "Mage Power" is the only Spell Card in your Spell and Trap Card Zone, the equipped monster would increase its ATK and DEF by 500 points.)
*   A Field Spell Card in your Field Spell Card Zone is included in the effect of your "Mage Power.
*   It does not matter if the Spell and/or Trap card(s) on your side of the field are face-up or face-down.
*   The only Spell and Trap cards included in the effect of "Mage Power" are the ones controlled by the person that is in control of the "Mage Power." If your opponent takes control of your monster that is equipped with your "Mage Power," "Mage Power" would still only count the Spell and Trap Cards on your side of the field. So if I have a Gemini Elf equipped with "Mage Power" and 2 Set Spell/Trap Cards and my opponent takes control of the equipped "Gemini Elf," they would not count how many Spell and Trap cards are on their side of the field. Only the ones on my side of the field would be included in the effect of "Mage Power."

#### MAGIC CYLINDER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of "Magic Cylinder" negates the attack of one attacking monster, but that monster is still considered to have attacked and may not attack again or have its Battle Position manually changed.
*   Monsters that may attack twice during the Battle Phase, such as "Hayabusa Knight", that have their first attack negated by the effect of "Magic Cylinder" may still make a second attack.
*   If the attack of "Goblin Attack Force" or "Spear Dragon" is negated by the effect of "Magic Cylinder", they will not be changed to Defense Position, since Damage Calculation never occurred.
*   The Damage caused by this card’s effect is equal to the current ATK of the attacking monster.
*   If an effect is chained to "Magic Cylinder" that destroys the attacking monster, or removes the attacking monster from the turn player’s side of the field (including switching it to your control, or sending it to the owner’s hand), no damage is dealt by the effect of "Magic Cylinder".

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Magic Cylinder” negates the attack before it reaches the Damage Step.
*   “Magic Cylinder” is considered a targeting effect.

#### MAGIC DRAIN

Netrep Rulings:

*   The discard from the effect of “Magic Drain” is not mandatory.

#### MAGIC JAMMER

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Magic Jammer” may only be activated in a chain to the initial activation of “Wave Motion Cannon.” “Magic Jammer” may not be activated in a response to the action of Tributing “Wave Motion Cannon.”
*   “Magic Jammer” must be activated in a chain with the activation of “Double Spell.” If “Double Spell” has successfully resolved, “Magic Jammer” may not be used to negate the activation of the Spell activated through the effect of “Double Spell.”

#### MAGIC REFLECTOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can put 2 or more counters on a Spell Card if you activate 2 or more "Magic Reflectors". When the Spell Card is destroyed, remove the counters on it 1-by-1.
*   You can activate "Magic Reflector" and put a counter on a Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished", and if the equipped card would be destroyed, remove 1 counter instead.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active, and if a Spell Card with a counter on it would be destroyed, the counter is removed instead. "Imperial Order" does not negate the function of counters created by the effect of "Magic Reflector".
*   If a Spell Card with a maintenance cost has a counter on it, such as "Messenger of Peace", and you choose not to pay the cost, the Spell Card is still destroyed.
*   If a Field Spell Card has a counter on it and a player activates a new Field Spell Card, the Field Spell Card with the counter is still destroyed.
*   If "Swords of Revealing Light" has a counter on it, it is still destroyed at the end of the opponent’s third turn after it was activated.
*   If you use "Magic Reflector" to place a counter on a Union Monster that is an Equip Card, and the Union Monster would be destroyed instead of the equipped monster, remove the "Magic Reflector" counter from the Union Monster instead, and the Union Monster is not destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Magic Reflector” does not produce a Spell Counter for the purposes of cards that use Spell Counters.
*   “Magic Reflector” will not prevent the affected Spell Card from being sent to the Graveyard if it was not destroyed.
*   “Magic Reflector” will not prevent the affected Spell Card from returning to the hand as that action does not destroy the Spell Card.
*   Multiple copies of “Magic Reflector” may be used on the same face-up Spell Card.

#### MAGICAL EXPLOSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Count the number of Spell Cards in the Graveyard at the time “Magical Explosion” resolves.

#### MAGICAL HATS

Netrep Rulings:

*   A monster Token may be declared as the target for “Magical Hats.”
*   If “Black Pendant” is Special Summoned to the field through the effect of “Magical Hats” and goes to the Graveyard, the effect of “Black Pendant” will activate.

#### MAGICAL MARIONETTE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   There is no limit to the number of Spell Counters you can have on "Magical Marionette".
*   Removing Spell Counters from "Magical Marionette" to use its effect is a cost.
*   You can use "Magical Marionette"'s effect multiple times in the same turn, as long as you have enough Spell Counters to pay the cost.
*   You can destroy "Magical Marionette" with its own effect.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Magical Marionette", "Magical Marionette" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Magical Marionette" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Magical Marionette” constantly checks the number of Spell Counters on it for the purposes of calculating ATK.

#### MAGICAL MERCHANT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You need to show the cards to your opponent, including the one you keep.
*   If you pick up your entire Deck and there were no Spell or Trap Cards, then "Magical Merchant"'s effect disappears.

#### MAGICAL PLANT MANDRAGOLA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Includes your opponent's cards that are capable of having Spell Counters placed on them.

#### MAGICAL SCIENTIST

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can use "Magical Scientist"'s effect multiple times in the same turn.
*   "Magical Scientist"'s effect does not target.
*   If the Fusion Monster is flipped face-down with "Book of Moon", or removed from play with "Dimensionhole" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Different Dimension Gate", the effect is reset and the Fusion Monster does not go back to the Fusion Deck, and is not prohibited from attacking your opponent's Life Points directly.
*   If you Special Summon "Reaper on the Nightmare" with "Magical Scientist", it cannot attack your opponent's Life Points directly (but can attack a monster).
*   You cannot activate "Secret Pass to the Treasures" targeting a Fusion Monster Special Summoned with "Magical Scientist" because it cannot attack your opponent's Life Points directly that turn.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after a Fusion Monster is Special Summoned with "Magical Scientist", the effect of "Magical Scientist" (that makes the Fusion Monster unable to attack directly and have to go back to the Fusion Deck) has been applied already, and is not negated, so the Special Summoned Fusion Monster still cannot attack directly and must go back to the Fusion Deck.
*   If "Jowgen the Spiritualist" is on the field, you cannot activate the effect of "Magical Scientist" (so you cannot even pay the cost to try and activate "Last Turn", for example).

#### MAGICAL THORN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have two copies of "Magical Thorn" active on the field, your opponent will take 1000 points of damage whenever they discard a card. If you have three copies, they will take 1500 points of damage.
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is applied when the opponent discards during the End Phase to make their hand size 6, discarding for the cost of cards such as "Tribute to the Doomed", "Cost Down", or "Judgment of Anubis", and discarding for card effects such as "Delinquent Duo", "Confiscation", "Robbin’ Goblin", "Morphing Jar" and "Mefist the Infernal General".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is NOT applied when you send cards from your hand to the Graveyard for things such as a Tribute for a Ritual Spell Card, a Fusion Material Monster, or the effects of cards like "Chosen One" or "Gravekeeper’s Watcher".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is NOT applied when cards in your hand are destroyed by "Chain Destruction" or when cards are sent from the Deck to Graveyard by the effect of "Painful Choice". It is also NOT applied when cards in your hand are removed from play by the effect of "Lightforce Sword".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is only applied when a card is discarded from your opponent’s hand to your opponent’s Graveyard. So if they have your card in your hand by the effect of "Exchange" or "Graverobber" and they discard it, they do not take any damage from the effect of "Magical Thorn".
*   If the opponent discards from their hand as a cost to activate a card like "Cost Down" and you chain "Magical Thorn" they will not take any damage. If your opponent activates a card where discarding is part of the effect of the card, such as "Card Destruction", and you chain "Magical Thorn", they WILL take damage because the effect of "Magical Thorn" will be active before the discarding effect resolves.
*   "Magical Thorn" deals damage per card, so if the opponent activates "Graceful Charity" they will take 1000 points of damage when they discard 2 cards. If they discard 5 cards to activate "Final Destiny" they take 2500 points of damage.
*   Even though "Magical Thorn" does damage per card discarded, it deals the damage as one lump sum for effects like "Dark Room of Nightmare".
*   "Necrovalley" does not negate the effect of "Magical Thorn".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" inflicts damage after an effect resolves. So if the effect of "Morphing Jar" is activated, the damage will be dealt after the new cards are drawn. This means if your opponent has 100 Life Points, and you have "Magical Thorn" active on the field but only one card left in your Deck, you will lose the Duel before the effect of "Magical Thorn" can deal damage to reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0.
*   "Magical Thorn" will deal damage between steps in a chain. For example, both you and your opponent have 100 Life Points remaining, your opponent has two cards in their hand and you have "Magical Thorn" active on the field and a Set "Mind Crush". It is your opponent’s turn and they activate "Final Flame" to deal 600 points of damage to you, and you chain "Mind Crush" calling the "Sinister Serpent" you know they have in their hand. After Step 2 ("Mind Crush") resolves, the effect of "Magical Thorn" deals 500 points of damage to your opponent and you win the Duel before Step 1, "Final Flame", resolves.

#### MAHARAGHI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If two copies of "Maharaghi" had their effects activated, you resolve them one at a time. This means you look at 1 card, and if you place it back on top of your Deck, you will see it again for the second effect.

#### MAIDEN OF THE AQUA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is active only when there is no face-up Field Spell Card on the field. When a Field Spell Card is activated after "Maiden of the Aqua" is Summoned, the effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is negated as long as there is a face-up Field Spell Card. If the only Field Spell Card is face-down, the effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is active. If there is a face-up Field Spell Card but it is negated by "Imperial Order", the effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is not active.
*   If a Field Spell Card is already active, and "Maiden of the Aqua" is Summoned, the existing Field Spell Card continues to function and "Maiden of the Aqua"’s effect is not applied until there is no face-up Field Spell Card.
*   While "Maiden of the Aqua" is making the field "Umi", you can activate "Tornado Wall" but if "Maiden of the Aqua" is destroyed, "Tornado Wall" is also destroyed.
*   If "Maiden of the Aqua", "Umi", and "Tornado Wall" are all on your side of the field, and "Umi" is destroyed, "Tornado Wall" is not destroyed because "Maiden of the Aqua" treats the field as "Umi" as soon as "Umi" leaves play.
*   If you have "Maiden of the Aqua" (with her effect active) and "The Legendary Fisherman" or "Deepsea Warrior" on your side of the field, and "Dark Hole" is activated, "The Legendary Fisherman" and "Deepsea Warrior" will not be destroyed.
*   If you have "Maiden of the Aqua" and "Tornado Wall" on the field, and "Maiden of the Aqua" is attacked by "Dark Driceratops" and Battle Damage would be inflicted, "Tornado Wall" still prevents the damage during damage calculation, as "Maiden of the Aqua" will remain on the field until the end of the Damage Step.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Maiden of the Aqua” is not a valid Tribute for “Levia Dragon - Daedalus’s” effect.

#### MAJI-GIRE PANDA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Maji-Gire Panda” is a Trigger Effect that activates when 1 or more Beast-Type monster(s) are destroyed. If the monsters were destroyed as a result of battle, the timing of this effect is at the end of the Damage Step, when the monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can chain to the activation of “Maji-Gire Panda”’s effect, including with “Divine Wrath”.
*   If 2 or more Beast-Type monsters are destroyed at the same time, the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” only increases by 500 points.
*   Beast-Type tokens like “Sheep Tokens” are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.
*   Monsters changed to Beast-Type by “DNA Surgery” are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.
*   Beast-Type monsters on your opponent’s side of the field are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.
*   When face-down Beast-Type monsters are destroyed (by a card effect), the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” does not increase.
*   The ATK increase from the effect of “Maji-Gire Panda” remains as long as “Maji-Gire Panda” remains face-up on the field.

#### MAJOR RIOT

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Major Riot” may only be activated when an opponent’s effect forces a monster to return to the hand.
*   “Major Riot” may not be activated in the Damage Step.

#### MAJU GARZETT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can't search for "Maju Garzett" with "Sangan" or "Mystic Tomato".
*   You can Tribute face-down monsters for "Maju Garzett" and their ATK will count towards "Maju Garzett"'s ATK.
*   "Maju Garzett"'s ATK will be 0 if you Special Summon it, or Tribute Summon it with a monster with "?" ATK (such as "Gradius' Option" or another "Maju Garzett"), or Tribute Summon it with only 1 Tribute using "Cost Down", or equip it with "Megamorph", or if it's flipped face-down and then face-up again, or if you Tribute Summon it with Mirage Tokens, or if you remove it from play with "Dimensionhole" and it returns to the field.
*   If "Skill Drain" is active, "Maju Garzett"'s ATK is reset to 0 even if "Skill Drain" is later destroyed.
*   If "Maju Garzett" battles "Cat's Ear Tribe", its original ATK is changed to 200 for the battle, then after the battle its ATK is reset to 0.
*   When you Tribute Monster Tokens to Tribute Summon "Maju Garzett", the sum of their ATK's will be the ATK of "Maju Garzett".
*   When you Tribute Summon "Maju Garzett", your opponent can use "Trap Hole" or "Bottomless Trap Hole" if appropriate.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Maju Garzett” is Tribute Set, it will not change its ATK value.
*   If “Maju Garzett” is flipped face-down, it will reset its ATK value to 0.
*   If “Maju Garzett” is not Tribute Summoned, it will remain at 0 ATK.

#### MAKYURA THE DESTRUCTOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card's effect is a Continuous Effect.
*   You cannot activate a "Raigeki Break" in your hand by discarding "Makyura the Destructor" as a cost.

#### MALEVOLENT NUZZLER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If a "Sangan" or a "Witch of the Black Forest" equipped with "Malevolent Nuzzler" is Tributed and you activate the effect of "Malevolent Nuzzler", "Malevolent Nuzzler" goes on top of your Deck and then "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest" is resolved. If "Sangan" is destroyed (not Tributed) the effects of "Sangan" and "Malevolent Nuzzler" are simultaneous and form a chain.

#### MALICE DOLL OF DEMISE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your opponent takes control of your "Malice Doll of Demise", and sends it to the Graveyard by the effect of a Continuous Spell Card, you can still activate its effect to Special Summon it during your Standby Phase.
*   If "Malice Doll of Demise" is Tributed to activate the effect of "Mass Driver", then "Malice Doll of Demise’s" effect does not activate because the Tribute is treated as a cost, not an effect.
*   Examples of Continuous Spell Cards that would send "Malice Doll of Demise" from the field to the Graveyard by their effect include "Ectoplasmer" and "Continuous Destruction Punch".
*   You can only activate the Special Summoning effect of “Malice Doll of Demise” during your first Standby Phase after it was sent to the Graveyard by the effect of a Continuous Spell Card. If you miss that, you cannot then activate the Special Summoning effect later on. If there is no monster card zone at the appropriate time, the effect is activated but you cannot Special Summon the “Malice Doll of Demise”, so its effect disappears.
*   The effect of "Malice Doll of Demise" activates in the Graveyard. If "The End of Anubis" is on the field during the Standby Phase in which "Malice Doll of Demise" would activate its effect, then the effect is negated and "Malice Doll of Demise" is not Special Summoned. If "The End of Anubis" leaves play after that, you still cannot activate "Malice Doll of Demise"’s effect because the opportunity has passed.

#### MAN-EATER BUG

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Man-Eater Bug" is the only monster on the field when it is flipped, it destroys itself.

#### MANGA RYU-RAN

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Manga Ryu-Ran” may not be Special Summoned by the effect of “The Flute of Summoning Dragon” regardless of the presence of “Toon World.”

#### MANTICORE OF DARKNESS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Manticore of Darkness"' effect can be activated during the End Phase when it was sent to the Graveyard from the field, hand, or your Deck that same turn.
*   When you send 1 "Manticore of Darkness" to the Graveyard to Special Summon another "Manticore of Darkness", you can then send the new "Manticore of Darkness" to the Graveyard to Special Summon the first "Manticore of Darkness".
*   If "Card of Safe Return" is active, and "Manticore of Darkness" is Special Summoned with its effect, you can draw a card. So with 2 "Manticores of Darkness", 1 of them sent to the Graveyard, and "Card of Safe Return" in play, you can draw as many cards as you want.
*   When "Manticore of Darkness" is sent to the Graveyard because of hand size adjustment in the End Phase, you can activate its effect.
*   You can send a face-down Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast-Type monster to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect.
*   Sending monsters to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect is a cost.
*   You can't send a Monster Token to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect because Monster Tokens are taken off the field instead of going to the Graveyard.
*   The owner of "Manticore of Darkness" gets the effect, so if your opponent controls your "Manticore of Darkness" and it's sent to the Graveyard, you get to activate the effect.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of “Manticore of Darkness” will occur during either player’s End Phase.
*   Monster Tokens are not valid to satisfy the effect of “Manticore of Darkness.”
*   The effect of “Manticore of Darkness” activates in the Graveyard.
*   If two “Manticores of Darkness” are sent to the Graveyard in the same turn, one “Manticore of Darkness” will be Special Summoned to the Graveyard for each Beast Type, Winged Beast Type, or Beast Warrior Type sent to the Graveyard to satisfy the effect of “Manticore of Darkness.”
*   A “Manticore of Darkness” on the field may be sent to the Graveyard to Special Summon a “Manticore of Darkness” that was sent to the Graveyard that turn.“
*   “Necrovalley” does not negate the effect of “Manticore of Darkness.

#### MARAUDING CAPTAIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 2 "Maurading Captains" on your side of the field, the opponent cannot attack any face-up Warrior-Type monsters you control. They can attack your Life Points directly if they control a monster with an effect that allows it (Such as "Rainbow Flower", "Inaba White Rabbit", or a Toon Monster). They could also attack a non-Warrior Type monster you control.
*   Your opponent can attack face-down monsters while you have "Maurading Captain" on the field, even if the face-down monster is Warrior-Type.
*   If you control "Maurading Captain" and a Warrior-Type monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", the opponent must attack the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" if they choose to attack.
*   If you control 2 "Maurading Captains" and one of them is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", your opponent cannot attack either one.
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness", "Maurading Captain" and a Warrior-Type monster when your opponent attacks, you can use the effect of "Patrician of Darkness" to redirect the attack to "Patrician of Darkness" or "Maurading Captain" only. Not to the other Warrior-Type monster because it cannot be attacked.
*   The monster Special Summoned by the effect of "Maurading Captain" does NOT have to be a Warrior-Type monster.
*   If your opponent activates "Torrential Tribute" in response to the Summoning of "Maurading Captain" (by chaining to the Trigger Effect of "Marauding Captain"), all monsters on the field will be destroyed, and then you Special Summon for "Maurading Captain"’s effect. If they wait and activate "Torrential Tribute" in response to the Special Summoning of a monster for the effect of "Marauding Captain", then all monsters will be destroyed including the newly-Special Summoned monster.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If my opponent attacks “Marauding Captain” on my side of the field can I activate “Shift” and redirect the attack to another Warrior-Type monster?  
    A: The other monster is not a legal target for “Shift” in this case, because “Marauding Captain” will not allow it to be attacked. Curtis Schultz, 12/20/2003

#### MARYOKUTAI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This monster’s effect is multi-trigger, and therefore Spell Speed 2. So it may be used against Quick-Play Spell Cards.
*   You can Tribute "Maryokutai" to activate its effect during the Battle Phase if it is not attacking or being attacked.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Maryokutai” may be Tributed during the Damage Step as long as it is not involved in that battle.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can “Maryokutai” be legally activated to counter a card used during the Damage Step to increase or decrease the ATK or DEF of a monster?  
    A: This is legal during the Damage Step. bishop, 01/08/2004

#### MASK OF BRUTALITY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The payment of 1000 Life Points is optional and the controller of "Mask of Brutality," not the controller of the equipped monster, chooses to pay or not. If you choose not to pay 1000 Life Points, "Mask of Brutality" is destroyed.

#### MASK OF RESTRICT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Fusion Material Monsters are not Tributes, so a Fusion Monster may be Special Summoned while this card is active on the field.
*   If "Mask of Restrict" is chained to a Ritual Spell Card, the effect of the Spell Card cannot resolve and no monsters are Tributed from the hand or field.
*   If "Mask of Restrict" is active, a Toon Monster that requires Tributes cannot be Special Summoned. The activation of "Mask of Restrict" cannot be chained to the Summoning of a Toon Monster, but it can be chained to the activation of "Toon World".
*   If "Mask of Restrict" is chained to the effect of "Cannon Soldier" you will still take damage because Tributing a monster is a cost of "Cannon Soldier" and is performed when the effect of "Cannon Soldier" is activated. If "Mask of Restrict" is chained to your opponent’s "Share the Pain" you do not have to Tribute a monster, but your opponent still does because it is a cost.

#### MASKED SORCERER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of "Masked Sorcerer" includes Battle Damage caused when it is attacked in Defense Position by a monster with ATK lower than "Masked Sorcerer"’s DEF.

#### MASS DRIVER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Tributing a monster for "Mass Driver" is a cost.
*   You can use "Mass Driver"'s effect repeatedly in the same turn as long as you can keep paying the cost.
*   The activation of "Mass Driver"'s effect can be chained to.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Multiple “Mass Drivers” do not offer more damage per Tribute.

#### MATAZA THE ZAPPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot use "Change of Heart" on a face-up "Mataza the Zapper".
*   If you take control of a face-down "Mataza the Zapper" and flip it face-up, it stays on your side of the field and doesn't return to the original controller.
*   If you use "Monster Reborn" on "Mataza the Zapper" while "Remove Brainwashing" is active, control of "Mataza the Zapper" does not return to the original owner.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, you can take control of "Mataza the Zapper" from your opponent.

#### MAZERA DEVILLE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot use "Monster Reborn", etc. on "Mazera DeVille" even if he is Special Summoned properly, because he "cannot be Special Summoned, EXCEPT by...".
*   If you Special Summon "Mazera DeVille", his effect activates, and your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Pandemonium" in a chain, "Mazera Deville"'s effect disappears because his effect needs "Pandemonium" on the field when the effect resolves, not just when it activates (just like "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn").
*   If your opponent has less than 3 cards in his hand, he must discard his entire hand.

#### MECHA-DOG MARRON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If “Mecha-Dog Marron” is destroyed in the middle of a chain, its effect starts a new chain when the current chain has finished resolving.
*   You can use “Barrel Behind the Door” against either effect of “Mecha-Dog Marron”.

#### MECHANICAL HOUND

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “Activate” means make the card face-up, or activate it from your hand. If “Mechanical Hound” is face-up on the field, your opponent can still use the effects of Continuous Spell Cards that are already face-up on the field.

#### MEGA TON MAGICAL CANNON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Removing Spell Counters is a cost. If you do not have 10 Spell Counters you cannot activate "Mega-Ton Magical Cannon".

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Could a player play the “Mega Ton Magical Cannon,” add a Spell Counter to their “Royal Magical Library” and to their “Magical Marionette” (to make a total 10 Spell Counters) and then resolve “Mega Ton Magical Cannon's” effect (Remove 10 Spell Counters on your side of the field. Destroy all cards on your opponent's side of the field.)?  
    A: No, you may not activate “Mega Ton Magical Cannon” if you do not have 10 Spell Counters on the field. bishop, 01/08/2004

#### MEGAMORPH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Megamorph" changes the original ATK of the monster it is equipped to. Having multiple "Megamorphs" equipped to a monster is the same as having one.
*   "Megamorph" is always recalculating with every change in Life Points. For example, your "Jirai Gumo" is equipped with "Megamorph" and you have 8000 Life Points compared to your 7000. You declare an attack with "Jirai Gumo" and lose the coin toss, losing 4000 Life Points. Now "Jirai Gumo"’s ATK is doubled before Damage Calculation.
*   When Life Points are equal the equipped monster’s ATK is unchanged.
*   You may equip "Megamorph" to your opponent’s monster, but ‘your Life Points’ refers to the controller of "Megamorph". So if you have more Life Points than your opponent, your opponent’s monster equipped with "Megamorph" has its ATK halved.

#### MEGAROCK DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You must remove from play at least 1 Rock-Type monster in your Graveyard in order to Special Summon “Megarock Dragon”.
*   The original ATK of “Megarock Dragon” is determined by its effect. This is further doubled/halved by “Megamorph” and other effects that are based off of original ATK. So if you Special Summon “Megarock Dragon” with an original ATK of 2100 points, then equip it with “Megamorph”, its ATK will be 4200 or 1050 depending on your Life Points.
*   If “Skill Drain” is active while “Megarock Dragon” is in play, the effect of “Megarock Dragon” is negated and its original ATK and DEF are treated as zero. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed later, the original ATK and DEF of “Megarock Dragon” will remain zero.
*   If “Megarock Dragon” is flipped face-down, or removed from play, or sent to the Graveyard, its effect is wiped and its original ATK and DEF are zero.

#### MERMAID KNIGHT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Mermaid Knight" can attack twice if "Maiden of the Aqua" is making the field treated as "Umi".
*   If you declare your second attack with "Mermaid Knight", and "Umi" is destroyed during the Battle Step, a replay occurs and you cannot attack a second time with "Mermaid Knight".
*   If there is no "Umi" on the field and "Mermaid Knight" attacks, then you Special Summon "Maiden of the Aqua" to treat the field as "Umi", you can attack a second time.

#### MESSENGER OF PEACE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The maintenance cost is optional, you may chose not to play 100 Life Points and "Messenger of Peace" will be destroyed.
*   The ATK of an attacking monster may increase above 1500 after the attack is declared.

#### METALLIZING PARASITE - LUNATITE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" is equipped to a monster, and "Final Destiny" is activated, all monsters are destroyed except for the monster equipped with "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite".
*   If you equip "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" to a monster that has been affected by "Limiter Removal", the monster is still destroyed during the End Phase by "Limiter Removal"'s effect.

#### METALMORPH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you equip two copies of "Metalmorph" to a single monster, its ATK and DEF will be increase by 600 and the second effect will add half of your attack target’s ATK to the equipped monster’s ATK twice.
*   The second effect of this card only increases the equipped monster’s ATK when it is the attacking monster (during your Battle Phase) not when it is being attacked during your opponent’s Battle Phase.
*   If "Reverse Trap" is activated, a monster equipped with "Metalmorph" will have its ATK and DEF decreased by 300 points, but the second effect of "Metalmorph" will be unaffected and still increase the equipped monster’s ATK by an amount equal to half of the attacked monster’s ATK.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Metalmorph” may be activated in the Damage Step.
*   Multiple “Metalmorphs” equipped to the same monster will have a cumulative effect.

#### METALSILVER ARMOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Your opponent cannot activate "Monster Reborn" and other cards that target while you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor". Your opponent can activate "Raigeki", "Mirror Force", and other cards that do not target.
*   If you attack with "Dark Magician", and you control another monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent cannot activate "Magic Cylinder" because "Magic Cylinder" targets and only the monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor" can be targeted (and it is not attacking).
*   If you have "Metalsilver Armor" active, your opponent cannot target his/her monsters either (with Equip Spell Cards, etc.), including with "Premature Burial".
*   If you have 2 monsters equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent cannot activate any effects that target 1 monster.
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent CAN activate the effect of "Nimble Momonga" or "Giant Germ" because their effects do not target 1 card.
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent CAN activate "Reinforcement of the Army".
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent CAN activate the effect of "The Thing in the Crater" because it Special Summons a monster from your HAND.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Continuous targeting Spell and Trap cards that affect a monster before “Metalsilver Armor” is equipped to another monster remain in effect on the original target.

#### METALZOA

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can you attack with a “Zoa” equipped with “Metalmorph” and then offer it to Special Summon “Metalzoa” during the Battle Phase to attack with the newly summoned monster?  
    A: You can only perform that Special Summon during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn only. Curtis Schultz, 01/05/2004

#### METAMORPHOSIS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Metamorphosis does not properly Summon a Fusion Monster, so you cannot use "Monster Reborn" on it afterwards.
*   Tributing a monster is a cost.
*   You can Tribute a face-down monster.
*   If you activated “Soul Exchange” targeting your opponent’s monster, if the monster is face-down, you cannot Tribute it as a cost for “Metamorphosis”.
*   You can Tribute a Monster Token (including a Sheep Token from "Scapegoat").
*   If there is no monster with the same level as the Tributed monster in your Fusion Deck, then you cannot activate this card.
*   "Metamorphosis" vs. "A Legendary Ocean": if you want to Special Summon a Level 6 Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck, you have to Tribute a Level 7 WATER monster on the field because it is treated as a Level 6.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The player activating “Metamorphosis” must have a Fusion monster of the appropriate level that can be Special Summoned in his or her Fusion Deck.

#### METEOR OF DESTRUCTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate “Meteor of Destruction”, and an effect is chained that causes your opponent’s Life Points to fall below 3000, “Meteor of Destruction” was already activated properly, so it resolves as normal.

#### METEORAIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "Meteorain" during your turn at any point from the Draw Phase to the end of your Battle Phase; you cannot activate it during the Damage Step, Main Phase 2, your End Phase, or your opponent's turn.

*   “Michizure” may not be activated in the Damage Step.

Other Rulings:

*   "Michizure" may be activated during any phase of your turn or your opponent's turn (if it had been set in your prior turn or before). However, it can only be activated if the very last event is a chainable one that sent the controller's monster to the Graveyard.
*   "Michizure" cannot be used in response to a tribute for effects such as "Cannon Soldier," "Hysteric Fairy," "Tribe Infecting Virus," and the like since the last thing to happen is the effect of such cards, not the sending of the monster to the Graveyard.
*   The effect of "Michizure" targets a monster.
*   The effect of "Michizure" cannot be used if the monster is used as tribute for a Ritual Summon, as Fusion Summon material, or for the effect of "Metamorphosis" since the last thing to happen is the summon, not the monster being sent to the Graveyard.

#### MILLENNIUM SCORPION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If “Millennium Scorpion” attacks and destroys a Monster Token, the effect of “Millennium Scorpion” does not activate because a Monster Token isn’t sent to the Graveyard.
*   If “Millennium Scorpion” has an ATK boost from its effect, but is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, or flipped face-down, the effect is reset and its ATK returns to normal.

#### MINAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the summoning of "Minar" is negated by "Solemn Judgment", etc. its effect is not activated, as it is not considered to have gone directly from your hand to the Graveyard.

#### MIND CONTROL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Mind Control” that prevents the targeted monster from attacking or being Tributed lasts until the End Phase of the turn ”Mind Control” was activated, even if the monster is flipped face-down before the End Phase. If the monster targeted with this card is flipped face-down, it will still return to the original owner's side of the field during the End Phase.

Judge List Rulings:

*   The monster you take control of with "Mind Control" cannot be Tributed. You cannot Tribute it to summon a high-level monster. You cannot Tribute it with "Metamorphosis."

*   If the opponent doesn’t have the named card, you can check their hand to confirm.

#### MIND ON AIR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Mind on Air"’s effect is continuous, so if you Summon "Mind on Air" and your opponent responds with "Trap Hole", your opponent must show their hand until "Mind on Air" is no longer on the field (after "Trap Hole" resolves).
*   If "Mind on Air" is causing your opponent’s hand to be revealed, and an effect that randomly selects a card is activated (like "Robbin’ Goblin"), your opponent shuffles their hand and you must choose randomly without seeing the fronts of the cards.

#### MINE GOLEM

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Mine Golem” is a Trigger Effect that activates when “Mine Golem” is sent to the Graveyard after having been destroyed as a result of battle. It can be chained to.

#### MINEFIELD ERUPTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate “Minefield Eruption”, you inflict damage, then send your “Mine Golem”(s) to the Graveyard. So your opponent has missed the timing and cannot activate “Numinous Healer”, etc.
*   The number of “Mine Golem” cards is considered when “Minefield Eruption” resolves, not when it is activated.

#### MIRACLE FUSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Removing 2 Spell Counters is a cost.

#### MIRAGE DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this monster makes the opponent of this monster’s current controller unable to activate Trap Cards during the Battle Phase. If you take control of your opponent’s monster with "Change of Heart" during your turn, your opponent cannot activate Trap Cards during your Battle Phase, but you can.
*   The effect of this monster makes your opponent unable to activate Set Trap Cards. However, your opponent can still activate the effects of face-up Trap Cards such as "Type Zero Magic Crusher", "Ultimate Offering", "Skull Lair", "The Dragon’s Bead", and "Astral Barrier".

#### MIRAGE KNIGHT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Mirage Knight" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "Dark Flare Knight". So "Mirage Knight" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   "Mirage Knight" can be Special Summoned by "Dark Flare Knight"'s effect even if "Skill Drain" is active, because "Dark Flare Knight"'s effect activates in the Graveyard. However, "Mirage Knight"'s effects are negated by "Skill Drain".
*   When a "Mirage Knight" that was involved in battle is flipped face-down, it is not removed during the End Phase.
*   When a "Mirage Knight" that was involved in battle is removed from play with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Dimensionhole", it is not removed from play during the End Phase by its own effect.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Mirage Knight” raises its ATK based on the original ATK of the monster involved in battle with it.
*   If “Mirage Knight” is involved in Damage Calculation, it will be removed from play at the end of the turn.
*   If “Mirage Knight” is involved in battle while “Skill Drain” is active, it will not receive its increase to ATK. If “Skill Drain” is activated after “Mirage Knight” has been involved in battle and remains active through the End Phase, “Mirage Knight” will not be removed from play.

#### MIRAGE OF NIGHTMARE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If, after drawing during your opponent’s Standby Phase, your "Mirage of Nightmare" is destroyed before you have to discard, then you do not need to discard for its effect.
*   You may activate "Mystical Space Typhoon" during your Draw Phase to destroy "Mirage of Nightmare" before you have to discard during your Standby Phase. If your Draw Phase was skipped for some reason, you can still activate "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Mirage of Nightmare" before activating the effect of "Mirage of Nightmare" that will force you to discard. (You can activate any number of effects during your own Standby Phase in any order you wish, as long as required effects are dealt with by the time you leave the Standby Phase and enter your Main Phase 1.)
*   When the turn player controls "Mirage of Nightmare" and "Imperial Order": If you draw for "Mirage of Nightmare" during your opponent’s Standby Phase, and then activate "Imperial Order" after that, during your Standby Phase you will have 2 mandatory effects: discarding for "Mirage of Nightmare" and paying 700 Life Points for "Imperial Order" or else destroying it. In this case, you choose which effect to resolve first, and you can choose to resolve "Mirage of Nightmare" first, even though its effect will be negated by "Imperial Order". So you activate its effect, and do not discard. Then you can choose not to pay 700 Life Points to keep "Imperial Order", and "Imperial Order" will be destroyed. Then you can enter Main Phase 1, and you did not have to discard for "Mirage of Nightmare" (because its effect was negated at the time you chose to resolve it).
*   When the turn player controls "Imperial Order" and the opponent controls "Mirage of Nightmare": If the opponent controls "Mirage of Nightmare" going into the turn player’s Standby Phase, and the turn player already controls a face-up "Imperial Order", then there are 2 mandatory effects that must be resolved: the turn player must pay 700 Life Points or destroy "Imperial Order", and the opponent must draw cards for "Mirage of Nightmare". The turn player has priority to resolve an effect first. If the turn player passes, priority goes to the opponent. If the opponent also passes, then the turn player must resolve an effect, and must pay for "Imperial Order" or it is destroyed. If he does not pay, and "Imperial Order" is destroyed, then the opponent can draw for "Mirage of Nightmare".
*   The same procedure is used if both players control "Mirage of Nightmare". Generally, the turn player will first discard for "Mirage of Nightmare", then the opponent will draw for their "Mirage of Nightmare".
*   If you discard "Sinister Serpent" during your Standby Phase for the effect of "Mirage of Nightmare", you may add "Sinister Serpent" back to your hand during that same Standby Phase.
*   If you have multiple copies of "Mirage of Nightmare", you don’t draw for more than 1 because you have 4 cards in your hand from using the effect of only 1 of them; nor do you have to discard for the second copy because you didn’t draw any cards using its effect. If you draw so that you have 4 cards using 1 "Mirage of Nightmare", and some effect causes you to discard during that same Standby Phase, you may then activate the other "Mirage of Nightmare" to draw back up to 4; in this case you discard separately for each "Mirage of Nightmare" because you drew with both, and if 1 of them is destroyed you do not have to discard for its effect, only for the effect of the "Mirage of Nightmare" that was not destroyed.
*   If you have 4 or more cards in your hand during your opponent’s Standby Phase, do not draw, and do not discard during your next Standby Phase (the effect of "Mirage of Nightmare" is not applied).
*   If your Standby Phase is skipped because of "Solomon’s Lawbook", etc., do not discard for "Mirage of Nightmare".
*   Drawing for "Mirage of Nightmare" is considered 1 draw no matter how many cards are drawn, so you only gain 500 Life Points if you have "Solemn Wishes".
*   If you draw 3 cards for "Mirage of Nightmare", but only have 2 cards in your hand during your next Standby Phase, discard your entire hand (2 cards)

Netrep Rulings:

*   If Mirage of Nightmare is destroyed before you have to discard, then you do not need to discard for Mirage of Nightmare's effect.
*   You may use Mystical Space Typhoon during the Draw Phase to destroy Mirage of Nightmare before you have to discard.
*   If you have multiple copies of Mirage of Nightmare, you don't draw for more than 1 because you have 4 cards in your hand from using the effect of only 1 of them; nor do you have to discard for the second copy because you didn't draw any cards using its effect.
*   If you draw so that you have 4 cards using 1 Mirage of Nightmare, and some effect causes you to discard during that same Standby Phase, you may activate the other Mirage of Nightmare to draw back up to 4; in this case you discard separately for each Mirage of Nightmare, and if 1 of them is destroyed you do not have to discard for its effect, only for the effect of the Mirage of Nightmare that was not destroyed.
*   When both players have Mirage of Nightmare active, first the turn player discards for his/her Mirage of Nightmare, then the opponent draws for his/her Mirage of Nightmare. If you have 4 or more cards in your hand, do not draw, and do not discard down to 4 (Mirage of Nightmare's effect is not applied).
*   If the Standby Phase is skipped by Solomon's Lawbook, etc., do not discard for Mirage of Nightmare's effect.
*   If you discard Sinister Serpent during your Standby Phase for Mirage of Nightmare's effect, you may add Sinister Serpent back to your hand during that same Standby Phase.
*   Drawing for Mirage of Nightmare is considered 1 draw no matter how many cards are drawn, so you only gain 500 Life Points if you have Solemn Wishes, etc.
*   If you draw 3 cards for Mirage of Nightmare's effect, but only have 2 cards in your hand during your next Standby Phase, discard your entire hand (2 cards).
*   If you draw for Mirage of Nightmare, and then activate Imperial Order, so that Imperial Order is active during your Standby Phase, you do not have to discard for Mirage of Nightmare.
*   If you have Mirage of Nightmare and Imperial Order, during your Standby Phase you can activate Mirage of Nightmare's discard effect first (and NOT discard because Mirage of Nightmare's effect is negated) and THEN choose not to pay for Imperial Order, so Imperial Order is destroyed; you then enter your Main Phase 1 without having to discard for Mirage of Nightmare.
*   If Player A controls Mirage of Nightmare, and Player B controls Imperial Order, and it is Player B's Standby Phase, Player B has priority and may choose to resolve an effect first. If Player B passes priority, then it shifts to Player A and Player A may choose to resolve an effect. If Player A declines priority, it shifts back to Player B and Player B MUST resolve an effect. So Player B must choose whether or not to pay for Imperial Order, and if Player B does not pay for Imperial Order and it is destroyed, Player A can draw cards for Mirage of Nightmare.

#### MIRROR FORCE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Mirror Force” is not a targeting effect, regardless of the number of monsters it destroys.
*   Monsters turned face down or removed from the field in a chain with “Mirror Force” are not destroyed.

#### MIRROR WALL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Mirror Wall" is already face-up on the field when a monster declares an attack, "Mirror Wall" reduces the ATK of the attacking monster by half when the attack is declared.
*   If "Mirror Wall" is activated during an attack (including during the Damage Step), then it reduces the ATK of the attacking monster when "Mirror Wall" resolves. (Even though "Mirror Wall" normally reduces the attack by half when the attack is declared, it will still reduce the attack by half if you activate it after the attack is declared.)
*   If "Mirror Wall" halves the ATK of a monster, it remains halved as long as "Mirror Wall" remains face-up on the field. If "Mirror Wall" is removed from the field, the ATK of the monsters is restored.
*   If a monster attacks twice (over 2 turns, or if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” attacks twice in a row, etc.), its ATK is still only reduced by half once. So “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” will have 1500 ATK for both of its attacks, for example.
*   If you have 2 copies of "Mirror Wall", and a monster attacks, its ATK is one-quarter. So “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” would have 750 ATK, for example. If 1 of the "Mirror Wall" copies leaves play, then the ATK is increased to half (if both copies leave play, the ATK is restored to full.)
*   You can activate "Mirror Wall" during the Damage Step before damage calculation.
*   The effect of "Mirror Wall" does not target.
*   "Reverse Trap" will have no effect on "Mirror Wall".

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Mirror Wall” may be activated in the Damage Step.
*   “Mirror Wall’s” effect affects an affected monster until “Mirror Wall” is no longer on the field or is negated.
*   Payment to keep “Mirror Wall” on the field is optional.

#### MOBIUS THE FROST MONARCH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You select the Spell / Trap Cards when you activate the effect of "Mobius the Frost Monarch".
*   This effect targets.
*   If "Level Limit - Area B" is active and "Mobius the Frost Monarch" is successfully Tribute Summoned, "Level Limit - Area B" is a Continuous Spell Card so its effect is applied and the battle position of "Mobius the Frost Monarch" is changed to Defense Position. Then you can activate the effect of "Mobius the Frost Monarch".
*   If "Mobius the Frost Monarch" is Tribute Summoned by the effect of "Ultimate Offering" in the middle of a chain (and is not the last step of the chain to resolve), then you have missed the timing on his effect and you cannot activate his effect to destroy 2 Spell or Trap Cards.
*   If 1 of the 2 Spell or Trap Cards targeted by the effect of "Mobius the Frost Monarch" is destroyed by some card effect before his effect resolves, the remaining 1 card is still destroyed by his effect.

#### MOISTURE CREATURE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can Summon "Moisture Creature" by Tributing 2 monsters, but the effect will not be activated.
*   You cannot Summon "Moisture Creature" by Tributing 3 monsters if there are no Spell or Trap Cards on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   If you activate the effect of "Moisture Creature" and your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to the effect, the effect still resolves and all Spell and Trap Cards on your opponent’s side of the field are destroyed.

#### MOKEY MOKEY KING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Mokey Mokey King" that was Special Summoned by "Magical Scientist" is returned to the Fusion Deck, it has been removed from the field so its effect activates and you Special Summon as many "Mokey Mokey" as possible from your Graveyard.
*   Missing the Timing: If "Mokey Mokey King" leaves the field in the middle of a chain (for example, if destroyed by "Ring of Destruction" chained to "Pot of Greed", or Tributed for a Tribute Summon or for the effect of "Cannon Soldier", etc.,), you miss the timing and you cannot Special Summon. Only when the last action of the chain is the removal of "Mokey Mokey King" from the field, can you activate its effect.

#### MOKEY MOKEY SMACKDOWN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the effect of "Mokey Mokey Smackdown" is activated (by a Fairy-Type monster on your side of the field being destroyed), and afterwards you Summon a "Mokey Mokey", that "Mokey Mokey" will also have 3000 ATK even though it wasn’t on the field when the Fairy-Type monster is destroyed.

#### MOLTEN ZOMBIE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you Special Summon "Molten Zombie" face-down with "The Shallow Grave", etc., its effect does not activate.
*   When you Special Summon "Molten Zombie" and you have "Card of Safe Return", either effect can be Step 1 of the chain; your choice.

#### MONSTER GATE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you pick up a Spirit Monster, you cannot Special Summon it and it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   If you pick up a Guardian and don't have the corresponding Equip Spell Card on the field, you cannot Special Summon the Guardian and it is sent to the Graveyard. If you have the corresponding Equip Spell Card, the Guardian is Special Summoned.
*   If you go through your whole Deck without finding a card to pick up, "Monster Gate"'s effect is negated and the cards you picked up are shuffled back into the Deck.
*   Your opponent can chain "Royal Oppression"'s effect to negate "Monster Gate"'s effect.
*   Cards picked up that cannot be Normal Summoned are considered "sent to the Graveyard", not "discarded".
*   If you Special Summon "Dark Magician of Chaos" with "Monster Gate", the effect of "Dark Magician of Chaos" activates, but it activates after "Monster Gate" has fully resolved and sent other picked up cards to the Graveyard, so you can use "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect to retrieve a Spell Card that was picked up and sent to the Graveyard by "Monster Gate" in the process of searching for the "Dark Magician of Chaos".

#### MONSTER REBORN

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Monster Reborn” may only be activated if there is sufficient space in the controlling player’s Monster Field.
*   “Monster Reborn” specifically targets a card in the Graveyard.
*   If the card “Monster Reborn” has targeted is no longer in the Graveyard at resolution, the effect of “Monster Reborn” disappears.

#### MONSTER RECOVERY

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Monster Recovery” may be activated on a Token.
*   “Monster Recovery” may not be activated in the Damage Step.
*   If “Monster Recovery” is activated on an opponent’s monster that the player controls, that monster will return to the opponent’s Deck and the opponent will shuffle, but not draw.
*   If “Monster Recovery” is activated on an opponent’s monster that the player controls, the player who activated “Monster Recovery” will still return his or her hand to the Deck and draw the appropriate number of cards.

#### MONSTER REINCARNATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can select a card discarded by the effect of "Monster Reincarnation" as a target of the effect of that same "Monster Reincarnation" (returning the monster to your hand).

#### MORALE BOOST

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Morale Boost" and other Equip Spell Cards are destroyed at the same time with "Harpie's Feather Duster" or "Heavy Storm", "Morale Boost" does not inflict any damage.
*   While your "Morale Boost" is active, and you activate your opponent's Equip Spell Card that you had because of "Exchange", when that Equip Spell Card is removed from the field it is you that takes the damage.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when monsters are equipped to "Relinquished" or "Sword Hunter", and when such equipped monsters are removed from the field.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes "Kisetai", and Union Monsters equipped to another monster by their own effect, and when such equipped monsters are removed from the field, and when Union Monsters "detach" and become monsters again.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when you equip an Equip Spell Card to your opponent's monsters, and when such cards are removed from the field.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when you Summon "Guardian Elma" and resolve her effect.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when "Tailor of the Fickle" is used

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Morale Boost” is destroyed at the same time as an Equip Spell Card, the effect of “Morale Boost” does not apply.
*   If “Morale Boost” is negated when an Equip Spell Card is played or destroyed, the effect of “Morale Boost” does not apply.

#### MORPHING JAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If there are fewer than 5 cards in the Deck of either player when this card’s Flip Effect is activated, that player will lose the Duel, since the text of this card says "draw".

#### MORPHING JAR #2

Netrep Rulings:

*   Multiple monsters Special Summoned face-down by the effect of “Morphing Jar #2” may be "shuffled" to prevent the opponent from knowing where the monster was Special Summoned.
*   If “Morphing Jar #2” is flipped and destroyed in battle, “Morphing Jar #2” will not return to the deck and will not count in the number of monsters to be Special Summoned.
*   Monsters that are ineligible to be Special Summoned by “Morphing Jar #2” are sent to the Graveyard, but still count toward the number of monsters required to be Special Summoned.
*   Tokens are not counted for the monster counting effect of “Morphing Jar #2.”

#### MOTHER GRIZZLY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you attack with your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Mother Grizzly" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Mother Grizzly" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

#### MUCUS YOLK

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Zero damage is not damage, so "Mucus Yolk" must have its ATK increased somehow in order to inflict damage to the opponent and activate its effect.
*   "Mucus Yolk" can continue to activate its effect over and over again, as long as it keeps inflicting Battle Damage to the opponent.
*   If "Mucus Yolk" inflicts damage multiple times in the same turn, such as with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce", it only increases by 1000 points during your next Standby Phase.

#### MUDORA

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Mudora” checks the Graveyard of the controlling player for the purpose of calculating ATK bonuses.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: When you give control of “Mushroom Man #2” to your opponent, can your opponent use its effect during their turn to give control back to you?  
    A: Yes they can. In this way the “Mushroom Man #2” can have control passed between the two players for multiple turns by paying the 500 Life Point cost during their End Phase. Curtis Schultz, 12/10/2003

#### MUSTERING OF THE DARK SCORPIONS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 2 copies of "Cliff the Trap Remover" (for example) in your hand, you can Special Summon 1 of them with "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions". You can Special Summon him even if you already have "Cliff the Trap Remover" on your side of the field from before you activated "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions".
*   You don't have to Special Summon all possible monsters with "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions"; you can keep some in your hand if you want.

*   "My Body as a Shield" can only be used against effects that will destroy monsters at that time. So you cannot use "My Body as a Shield" when "Tribe-Infecting Virus" is summoned; you can only use it in response to the activation of "Tribe-Infecting Virus"'s effect, at which point the effect of "Tribe-Infecting Virus" is negated and "Tribe-Infecting Virus" is destroyed. Also, you cannot use "My Body as a Shield" against cards whose effects will not destroy a monster right away, so you cannot use "My Body as a Shield" against "Jigen Bakudan", "Ekibyo Drakmord", "Magical Hats", "Steel Scorpion", "Toon Monsters", "Thunder Nyan Nyan", "Gradius' Option", "Summoner of Illusions", "Limiter Removal", "Call of the Haunted", "Premature Burial", or "Autonomous Action Unit".

*   You cannot activate "My Body as a Shield" during the Damage Step, so you cannot use it against a "Man-Eater Bug" or "Cyber Jar" flipped by an attack, but you can use it when these monsters are Flip Summoned.
*   "Judgment of Anubis" may be chained to "My Body as a Shield".

#### MYSTERIOUS PUPPETEER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you have "Mysterious Puppeteer" face-up on the field, if you Summon a monster and you opponent activates "Trap Hole" your monster is destroyed and you still gain 500 Life Points, since the monster was Summoned and then destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Mysterious Puppeteer’s” effect is a Trigger effect.

#### MYSTIC SWORDSMAN LV2

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Mystic Swordsman LV2" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, that monster is destroyed by "Mystic Swordsman LV2"’s effect, not as a result of battle. So you cannot use its second effect to Special Summon "Mystic Swordsman LV4" during the End Phase.
*   If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if "Armed Dragon LV5" destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.

#### MYSTIC SWORDSMAN LV4

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Light of Intervention" is active, you cannot Normal Summon "Mystic Swordsman LV4" because it can only be Normal Summoned face-down, which "Light of Intervention" makes impossible to do.
*   If "Mystic Swordsman LV4" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, you destroy the monster with "Mystic Swordsman LV4"’s effect before flipping the monster face-up. Effects like "D. D. Warrior Lady" cannot activate.
*   If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if "Armed Dragon LV5" destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.

#### MYSTIC SWORDSMAN LV6

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Normal Summon (Tribute Summon) of this monster is the same as a Tribute Set. This card must be in face-down Defense Position when it is Normal Summoned (Tribute Summoned). If you Normal Summon (Tribute Summon) this monster, it is placed face-down on the field; you do not have to show your opponent what monster it is.
*   If your "Mystic Swordsman LV6" destroys your own monster that is being controlled by your opponent, that monster is sent to the Graveyard. You cannot return it to the top of your opponent’s Deck or the top of your own Deck.
*   If you activate the effect of "Mystic Swordsman LV6" to place a face-down monster on top of your opponent’s Deck, you do not get to look at it.
*   If "Mystic Swordsman LV6" attacks a face-down monster, its effect activates at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. If "Ceasefire" was activated during the Battle Step to flip the monster face-up, then the effect of "Mystic Swordsman LV6" is not activated.
*   A monster destroyed by the effect of "Mystic Swordsman LV6" is not destroyed as a result of battle. There is no damage calculation. It is not flipped face-up. Any Flip Effects it has are not activated.

#### MYSTIC TOMATO

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you attack with your "Mystic Tomato" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Mystic Tomato" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Mystic Tomato" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Mystic Tomato" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

#### MYSTICAL KNIGHT OF JACKAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   In order to activate the effect of "Mystical Knight of Jackal", the monster that "Mystical Knight of Jackal" destroyed as a result of battle must be your opponent’s own monster, not one of your monsters that your opponent controls.
*   "Mystical Knight of Jackal" sends a monster to the Graveyard as a result of battle, and THEN returns it to the top of the deck, so "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest", etc., will activate their effects.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is in play, the monster is removed from play and "Mystical Knight of Jackal" does not activate its effect so the monster does not return to the top of the Deck.
*   If "Mystical Knight of Jackal" attacks a face-down "Man-Eater Bug", and "Man-Eater Bug" destroys "Mystical Knight of Jackal", then the effect of "Mystical Knight of Jackal" is not applied.
*   "Mystical Knight of Jackal" does activate its effect even if "Necrovalley" is in play.
*   When "Mystical Knight of Jackal" attacks "Mystic Tomato", during the End Step both effects activate simultaneously once "Mystic Tomato" is sent to the Graveyard, so they form a chain. The turn player’s effect is Step 1 of a chain, and the opponent’s is Step 2; so "Mystic Tomato" resolves first, and a monster is Special Summoned and the Deck shuffled. Then the turn player chooses whether to place "Mystic Tomato" on top of the owner’s Deck with the effect of "Mystical Knight of Jackal".

#### MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Mystical Space Typhoon” may be activated in any phase.
*   “Mystical Space Typhoon” may not be activated during the Damage Step.
*   “Mystical Space Typhoon” is a targeting effect.“
*   If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is activated in a chain with the activation of “Call of the Haunted,” “Mystical Space Typhoon” will destroy the “Call of the Haunted” before “Call of the Haunted” Special Summons a monster. “Call of the Haunted’s” effect will then disappear. If “Call of the Haunted” is activated in a chain with a “Mystical Space Typhoon” that targets “Call of the Haunted,” “Call of the Haunted” will resolve fi rst, Special Summoning a monster. “Mystical Space Typhoon” will then resolve destroying the “Call of the Haunted.” If “Call of the Haunted” is not negated at this point, the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” will be destroyed.

#### MYSTIK WOK

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Tributing a monster for "Mystik Wok" is a cost, so you can Tribute "The Legendary Fisherman" or "The Agent of Force - Mars".
*   The ATK or DEF is the current number, not the original number.
*   You select ATK or DEF when "Mystik Wok" is activated.
*   You can Tribute face-down monsters, or your opponent's monster using "Soul Exchange".

#### NARROW PASS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Narrow Pass" can only be activated when Player A has 2 or fewer monsters and Player B has 2 or fewer monsters. So if there are 3 monsters in play (2 controlled by A and 1 by B) you can activate "Narrow Pass". But if either player controls 3 or more monsters on his side of the field then you cannot activate this card.
*   Once "Narrow Pass" is activate, as long as it remains face-up on the field, Player A can Normal Summon or Set 2 up to 2 additional monsters, and Player B can Normal Summon or Set up to 2 additional monsters. It is helpful to place counters on "Narrow Pass" to keep track.
*   If "Narrow Pass" is activate, and a player Normal Summons his 2 permitted monsters afterwards, if 1 of those is destroyed then he cannot replace it with another Normal Summon. Each player gets 2 additional Normal Summons or Sets, no matter what happens to those monsters afterwards.
*   "Narrow Pass" does not restrict Special Summons or Flip Summons.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Narrow Pass can only be activated when Player A has 2 or fewer monsters and Player B has 2 or fewer monsters. So if there are 3 monsters in play (2 controlled by A and 1 by B) you can activate Narrow Pass. But if either player controls 3 or more monsters by himself then you cannot activate this card.
*   Once Narrow Pass is activated, as long as it remains face-up on the field, Player A can Normal Summon or Set 2 up to 2 additional monsters, and Player B can Normal Summon or Set up to 2 additional monsters. It is helpful to place counters on Narrow Pass to keep track.
*   If Narrow Pass is activated, and I Normal Summon my 2 monsters afterwards, if 1 of those is destroyed then I cannot "replace" it with another Normal Summon. Narrow Pass does not restrict Special Summons or Flip Summons.

#### NECROVALLEY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Necrovalley" negates any effect that targets a card or cards in the Graveyard. So "Necrovalley" WILL negate the effect of: "Monster Reborn", "Premature Burial", "Call of the Haunted", "Question", "Backup Soldier", "Spear Cretin", "The Shallow Grave", "Magician of Faith", "Fiber Jar", "Penguin Knight", and "Agido".
*   "Necrovalley" negates costs and effects that require removing cards from the Graveyard.

So "Necrovalley" will NOT negate the effects of "Dark Necrofear" (when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard), "Revival Jam", "Winged Sage Falcos", "Twin-Headed Behemoth", "Mystical Knight of Jackal", and "Red-Moon Baby".
*   If "Necrovalley" is on the field, you can Special Summon "Gilasaurus" using its effect, but the effect that lets your opponent Special Summon is negated.
*   If the effect of "Necrovalley" is negated by "Imperial Order", then cards that require "Necrovalley" on the field, such as "Gravekeeper’s Assailant", etc., can still apply their effects because "Necrovalley" is still on the field.
*   If "Necrovalley" is active, neither player may activate "Book of Life".
*   If "Necrovalley" is active and you Special Summon the Spell Card "Gravekeeper’s Servant" with "Magical Hats", its ATK and DEF will be 500.

#### NEGATE ATTACK

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Negate Attack” stop the entire Battle Phase or just the Damage Step?  
    A: Negate Attack DOES stop the ENTIRE Battle Phase after it negates the opponent's attack. In other words, you are _NOT_ allowed to declare any more attacks, because the Battle Phase is over due to Negate Attack. Steve Okegawa, 01/02/2004

#### NEKO MANE KING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Neko Mane King" ends your opponent's turn, your opponent proceeds immediately to his/her End Phase, even if "Neko Mane King" is sent to the Graveyard during the Damage Step.
*   "Neko Mane King" doesn't actually end the turn, it advances play to the End Phase, so "Destiny Board" can still be used, etc.
*   "Neko Mane King"'s effect activates even if it is sent to the Graveyard while face-down on the field, or sent to the Graveyard from your Deck or hand.

*   “Neko Mane King’s” effect does not activate if it is destroyed as the result of battle.
*   “Neko Mane King’s” effect moves the current Turn to the End Phase.
*   If a player chains “Call of the Haunted” to “Mystical Space Typhoon” to Special Summon “Neko Mane King,” the opponent’s turn does not end as it is not the opponent’s effect that destroys “Neko Mane King.”
*   If “Neko Mane King” is in a player’s hand, the opponent’s turn will end if the opponent plays “Card Destruction” after the resolution of “Card Destruction.”

#### NEWDORIA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can destroy a face-down monster with "Newdoria".

Netrep Rulings:

*   The owner of “Newdoria” decides which monster will be destroyed by “Newdoria’s” effect.
*   “Newdoria’s” effect is mandatory.

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

*   Q: If "Newdoria" and "Pyramid Turtle" crash or destroy each other in battle can "Newdoria" destroy the monster summoned off of "Pyramid Turtle"?  
    A: No. "Newdoria" is a mandatory effect and "Pyramid Turtle" is an optional effect so "Newdoria" will be chain link 1 regardless of who turn player is. Newdoria must target at activation. So the target to be destroyed by "Newdoria" will need to be chosen before the effect of pyramid turtle activates.

#### NIGHT ASSAILANT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Night Assailant" doesn't have to be sent to the Graveyard by an effect, or by an effect controlled by your opponent; it just has to be sent to the Graveyard. "Night Assailant"'s effect activates when sent to the Graveyard as a cost for "Magic Jammer" or "Tribe-Infecting Virus"; "Night Assailant"'s effect activates after the current chain resolves.
*   "Night Assailant"'s effect activates when sent to the Graveyard by "Morphing Jar" or "Card Destruction".
*   "Night Assailant"'s effect activates when sent to the Graveyard for a Ritual Summon.
*   When "Night Assailant" is sent to the Graveyard by the effect of "Last Turn", FIRST resolve "Last Turn"'s effect of sending all cards on the field and in the hands to the Graveyard, SECOND activate and resolve the effect of "Night Assailant", and THIRD Special Summon a monster by the effect of "Last Turn".
*   You cannot select the "Night Assailant" that was itself sent to the Graveyard, so there is no infinite loop.
*   When multiple "Night Assailants" are sent to the Graveyard at the same time because of "Graceful Charity", etc., both can be returned to your hand because "Night Assailant" cannot select itself but CAN select a different "Night Assailant", even one that was sent to the Graveyard at the same time.
*   Both of "Night Assailant"'s effects target.
*   You cannot use "Night Assailant"'s second effect while "Necrovalley" is active.
*   If your opponent has your "Night Assailant" in his hand (because of "Exchange") and it's sent to the Graveyard, you (the owner) get the effect.
*   If you have "Forced Requisition" active (face-up) and 7 cards in your hand during the End Phase (and one of them is a "Night Assailant"), and there is another "Night Assailant" in your Graveyard, and you discard your "Night Assailant" because you have 7 cards, your opponent must discard because of "Forced Requisition". Then you can activate the effect of "Night Assailant" to retrieve the other "Night Assailant". Now you have 7 cards in your hand again so you can discard "Night Assailant", and your opponent must discard again for "Forced Requisition". You can continue doing this until your opponent loses all cards in their hand.

#### NIGHTMARE WHEEL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can target a face-down monster for "Nightmare Wheel".
*   If you activate "Nightmare Wheel" during the Battle Step and target a monster that is attacking, the attack stops.
*   "Nightmare Wheel" targets. You select the monster when "Nightmare Wheel" is activated.
*   "Nightmare Wheel" is destroyed when the targeted monster is destroyed, returned to the hand, removed from play, send to the Graveyard, etc.
*   "Nightmare Wheel" is NOT destroyed if the monster is flipped face-down. "Nightmare Wheel" continues to target the monster, inflict damage, and prevent the monster from attacking or changing battle position.
*   If a face-down monster targeted by the effect of “Nightmare Wheel” is rearranged by the effect of “Wandering Mummy” or “Shifting Shadows”, the monster’s controller must honestly announce which monster is the target of “Nightmare Wheel”.
*   The effect of "Nightmare Wheel" will be negated by "Royal Decree", so you can attack or change the battle position of the monster. Also, if "Royal Decree" is active, and the monster is removed from the field, "Nightmare Wheel" remains on the field meaninglessly because its text that would destroy it is negated. If "Royal Decree" is later destroyed, the effects of "Nightmare Wheel" are not applied (such as the 500 damage) if there is no monster being targeted by "Nightmare Wheel".
*   The effect of "Nightmare Wheel" is still applied if the targeted monster changes sides.
*   If the monster targeted by "Nightmare Wheel" becomes equipped to "Relinquished", then "Nightmare Wheel" is destroyed.

*   The owner of “Nimble Momonga” will get the increase in Life Points if “Nimble Momonga” is destroyed in battle, regardless of who controlled “Nimble Momonga.”

#### NINJA GRANDMASTER SASUKE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect activates at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. So if "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" will not destroy it with his effect because it is not flipped face-up until after "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect would activate.
*   A face-up Defense Position "Spirit Reaper" will be destroyed by the effect of "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke". "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect does not target. So if "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks "Spirit Reaper", "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect, not by "Spirit Reaper"’s effect.
*   If "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-up Defense Position "D. D. Warrior Lady", "D. D. Warrior Lady" is destroyed by the effect of "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" and "D. D. Warrior Lady"’s effect is not activated.
*   If "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-up Defense Position monster, and you flip it face-down during the Battle Step with "Book of Moon", the monster is face-down at the start of the Damage Step so "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" will not destroy it with his effect.
*   If "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, and "Ceasefire" is activated during the Battle Step, the monster is face-up at the start of the Damage Step so it will be destroyed by "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect.

#### NINJITSU ART OF DECOY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the Ninja is destroyed or otherwise removed from the field by a card effect, "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   If the Ninja is removed from the field temporarily, or flipped face-down, "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy"’s effect is no longer applied.
*   If "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy" is active, then "Royal Decree" is activated and negates "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy"’s effect, then "Royal Decree" is later destroyed, "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy"’s effect is not re-applied.

#### NINJITSU ART OF TRANSFORMATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Ninjitsu Art of Transformation" does not target; you select the monster to Special Summon when you resolve its effect.
*   If "The Legendary Ocean" is active, your WATER monsters in your hand are lowered by 1 level so if you Special Summon from your hand using "Ninjitsu Art of Transformation", you can Summon at 1 level lower (effectively making it Level +4 if looking at the original Level).
*   "The selected card" means the Tributed card.

#### NITRO UNIT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you equip “Nitro Unit” to a monster on your opponent’s side of the field, then you take control of that monster, “Nitro Unit” is destroyed because the monster is no longer on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   If your opponent controls your monster, and you target it with “Nitro Unit”, but your opponent chains “Remove Brainwashing”, “Nitro Unit” is destroyed because its target is no longer on your opponent’s side of the field when “Nitro Unit” resolves.
*   When the monster equipped with “Nitro Unit” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, the effect of “Nitro Unit” can be chained to.
*   The damage inflicted by “Nitro Unit” is based on the equipped monster’s original ATK (in the Graveyard).

#### NOBLEMAN OF CROSSOUT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the targeted monster is a Flip Effect Monster, it is not flipped face-up and its Flip Effect is not activated. Both players must reveal their Decks to each other to verify that all cards of the same name as the Flip Effect Monster are removed from play.
*   The targeted monster, and any cards of the same name if the target was a Flip Effect Monster, are removed from play and never go to the Graveyard, so the effects of cards like "Sangan" will not activate.
*   Cards of the same name in your hand or on the field are NOT removed from play.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If I remove a card, say with “Nobleman of Crossout”, must my opponent show me their Deck to prove it contains no remaining copies? What if the card is “Fiber Jar”?  
    A: A game penalty would be in order should more than one "Fiber Jar" be in someone's deck. Of course, this should have already been resolved by a deck check prior to the tournament. To answer your question more generally, however, "Nobleman of Crossout" would allow for an opponent to check your deck to ensure compliance to the resolution of the effect. bishop, 01/23/2004

Other Rulings:

*   Your opponent may indeed ask that you prove there are no more of that card in your deck. It is their right to do so. The ruling is in place in order to allow the opponent the opportunity to verify that you do not have a 2nd or 3rd copy... Unfortunately, the ruling opens the door, that the opponent gets a chance to look at your deck. Now, you do NOT give your deck to your opponent, but you may fan through it to verify that there is not another card of that name in it. The opponent may NOT take the time to stop and read card effects, look at other cards, or use this as a stalling technique themselves. This almost comes down to a courtesy that if you don't look at mine, I won't look at yours, or if you look at mine, I will look at yours. So this part of the ruling almost never comes up in play. Gary Haynes, 04/27/2005

#### NOBLEMAN OF EXTERMINATION

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Fake Trap” is activated in a chain to “Nobleman of Extermination,” “Fake Trap” will destroy itself and “Nobleman of Extermination’s” effect will be negated. Other copies of “Fake Trap” will not be removed from play.
*   Trap cards that are activated in a chain with “Nobleman of Extermination” will not be removed by the effect of “Nobleman of Extermination.” “Nobleman of Extermination’s” effect will disappear in this case.

#### NOBLEMAN-EATER BUG

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate the effect of "Nobleman-Eater Bug" and select 2 monsters, then "Ring of Destruction" is chained and destroys 1 of the selected monsters, you still destroy the remaining monster when "Nobleman-Eater Bug"’s effect resolves.
*   If "Nobleman-Eater Bug" is the only monster on the field and it is flipped face-up, then it destroys itself with its effect.

#### NON AGGRESSION AREA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your opponent Flip Summons "Cyber Jar" while "Non-Aggression Area" is active, because he cannot Special Summon, the cards he would normally Summon that were picked up are destroyed. All the cards picked up with "Cyber Jar" that would not normally be Special Summoned (such as high-level monsters, Spell and Trap Cards, and monsters that are Special Summon-only) remain in the hand and are not destroyed.
*   If you activate "Non-Aggression Area", your opponent can still Special Summon THIS turn with "Call of the Haunted", etc.

#### NON-SPELLCASTING AREA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, you cannot use face-up monsters on the field, except Effect Monsters, for "Polymerization" or Ritual Spell Cards.
*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, no Spell Card, including "Raigeki" or Equip Spell Cards, can affect a monster, unless it is an Effect Monster.
*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, and only one player has Effect Monsters on the field, you can activate “Creature Swap” but its effect will be negated because none of the non-Effect Monsters can switch control due to a Spell Card’s effect.
*   The effect of “Non-Spellcasting Area” includes Ritual Monsters and Fusion Monsters that do not have effects, as well as Monster Tokens.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Non-Effect monsters may be targeted by Spell Cards while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active.
*   Tokens are considered Non-Effect monsters and are protected by the effect of “Non-Spellcasting Area.”
*   If “Change of Heart” is played on a face down non-Effect Monster and flipped face up while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is in effect, the non-Effect Monster will immediately return to its original controller.
*   If one player’s field has only face up non-Effect monsters when “Creature Swap” resolves while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is in effect, “Creature Swap’s” effect disappears.
*   If a non-Effect monster has been Special Summoned by “Premature Burial” and “Premature Burial” is destroyed while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, the monster Special Summoned by “Premature Burial” will remain on the field.

#### NUBIAN GUARD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Nubian Guard"'s effect is resolved after damage calculation.

#### NUMINOUS HEALER

Netrep Rulings:

*   "Numinous Healer” may be activated in the Damage Step.

#### NULL AND VOID

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only chain "Null and Void" to an effect that draws cards and does nothing else. You can chain "Null and Void" to the activation of "Pot of Greed" or "Jar of Greed". You can chain "Null and Void" to the activation of the effect of cards like "Airknight Parshath".
*   You can chain "Null and Void" to a Continuous Spell or Trap Card that causes drawing, such as "Mirage of Nightmare" or "Heart of the Underdog".
*   You cannot chain "Null and Void" to "Disturbance Strategy", "Graceful Charity", "Card Destruction", "Morphing Jar", "Mind Wipe", "Dragged Down into the Grave", or "Reload".
*   You can activate "Null and Void" during the Damage Step, for example against the effects of "Airknight Parshath", "Sasuke Samurai #3" or "Bistro Butcher".
*   The card(s) discarded by the effect of "Null and Void" are never treated as actually drawn, so they are considered sent from the Deck to the Graveyard.
*   You can chain "Null and Void" to "Reckless Greed". Since you cannot draw by the effect of "Reckless Greed", the effect of skipping 2 Draw Phases is NOT applied.
*   You can chain "Null and Void" to the effect of "Royal Magical Library".
*   You cannot chain "Null and Void" to the effect of "Appropriate" because the effect of "Appropriate" cannot be chained to.

#### NUTRIENT Z

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card can only be activated during your opponent’s Damage Step during the "Calculate and Apply Damage" portion or at any point in the Damage Step prior to that.
*   You must take the 2000 points or more of Battle Damage from a single attack. If you take 1000 points of damage from one attack, and then 1200 points of damage from a second attack, the effect of this card will not activate.
*   If "Hayabusa Knight" attacks you directly twice, the effect of this card will not activate. The Battle Damage must come from a single attack, not a single monster attacking twice.
*   You can activate 2 copies of "Nutrient Z" and you will gain 8000 Life Points if you would take 2000 points or more of Battle Damage.
*   You cannot activate "Kuriboh" in a chain to "Nutrient Z"’s effect. The effect of "Kuriboh" would reduce the Battle Damage to 0, and then the effect of "Nutrient Z" will no longer increase you Life Points. You must actually take the damage to gain the benefit of "Nutrient Z"’s effect.

#### NUVIA THE WICKED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Light of Intervention" is on the field this card cannot be Set and if Normal Summoned in face-up Defense Position it will be destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Skill Drain” is active when “Nuvia the Wicked” is Normal Summoned, “Nuvia the Wicked” will not be destroyed. If “Skill Drain” leaves the field or is negated after “Nuvia the Wicked” has been Normal Summoned, “Nuvia the Wicked” is not destroyed.

#### OBNOXIOUS CELTIC GUARD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" and "Celtic Guardian" are considered 2 separate monsters so you can have 3 of each in your Deck.
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard"’s effect looks at the ATK during Damage Calculation. So if he’s WIND and is attacked by "Insect Soldiers of the Sky", their ATK is 2000 during Damage Calculation and "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" is not destroyed. Or if an 1800 monster attacks and you use "Rush Recklessly" to increase the ATK to 2500 during the Damage Step, "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" is not destroyed.
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard"’s effect looks at current ATK, not original ATK. So a monster with 1000 original ATK equipped with "Megamorph" to make it 2000 ATK will not destroy "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" as a result of battle.
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" isn’t destroyed by damage calculation but can be destroyed by monster effects like "Ryu Kokki".
*   If "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" is attacked by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", or another monster that negates a card’s effect after it destroys it, "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" is not destroyed (so its effect is not negated).
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard"’s effect works for a battle caused by "Last Turn", so if it battles a monster with ATK 1900 or higher, neither is destroyed and the Duel is a draw.

#### OFFERINGS TO THE DOOMED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Skipping your next Draw Phase is not a cost, so if your opponent chains "Magic Jammer" or "Imperial Order" to negate this card, you do NOT skip your next Draw Phase.
*   If your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to flip the target of this card face-down, the monster is not destroyed and you will skip your next Draw Phase.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If the activation of “Offerings to the Doomed” is negated, that player does not skip his or her Draw Phase.
*   If multiple “Offerings to the Doomed” are activated in the same Turn, the activating Player will skip only one Draw Phase.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If I use “Offerings to the Doomed” on a face-up “Spirit Reaper,” do I still have to skip my next Draw Phase?  
    A: “Spirit Reaper” will be destroyed by “Offerings to the Doomed” and you must skip your next Draw Phase. bishop, 12/23/2003

#### OJAMA DELTA HURRICANE!!

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" or "Book of Moon" to "Ojama Delta Hurricane!!", and one of the Ojamas is destroyed or flipped face-down, "Ojama Delta Hurricane!!"'s effect still resolves.

#### OJAMA KING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot select occupied Monster Card Zones with "Ojama King"’s effect. If your opponent has 5 monsters on the field, then "Ojama King"’s effect is not applied.
*   "Ojama King"’s effect activates and you select up to 3 Monster Card Zones when "Ojama King" becomes face-up on the field.
*   If you select up to 3 Monster Card Zones and your "Ojama King" is flipped face-down, the Monster Card Zones are usable again. When "Ojama King" is flipped face-up again, you can select up to 3 Monster Card Zones again.
*   If you take control of your opponent’s face-up "Ojama King", you cannot select new Monster Card Zones because the zones are selected when "Ojama King" becomes face-up on the field.

#### OJAMA TRIO

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Ojama Trio" if there are not 3 vacant Monster Zones on your opponent's side of the field.
*   You cannot activate "Ojama Trio" if "Scapegoat" or "The Last Warrior from Another Planet" is preventing you from Summoning.
*   If there are Ojama Tokens on your opponent's side of the field, and "Remove Brainwashing" is activated, the Ojama Tokens are switched to your side of the field. If you don't have enough Monster Zones for them, some of the Ojama Tokens are destroyed and the damage is inflicted to the opponent.
*   When you chain Ojama Trio to your opponent's "Call of the Mummy" effect, the effect of "Call of the Mummy" is negated.
*   When your opponent activates "Snatch Steal", and you chain "Ojama Trio" to fill up his/her remaining Monster Zones, then there is no room for the stolen monster, and it is destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The opponent must have 3 open Monster Spaces to activate “Ojama Trio.”
*   If the opponent does not have 3 open Monster Spaces at the resolution of “Ojama Trio,” the effect of “Ojama Trio” disappears.
*   Damage is inflicted by the effect of “Ojama Trio” only when the Ojama Tokens are destroyed.
*   If “Remove Brainwashing” is active while Ojama tokens are on the field, the Ojama tokens will change to the side of the field of the player who activated “Ojama Trio.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can you chain “Ojama Trio” to the activation of a Spell or Trap Card that would Special Summon a monster in order to fill your opponents Monster Card Zone and prevent the Special Summon of the monster?  
    A: If there is no open Monster Zone spaces during the resolution of the card that will Special Summon the monster, the monster is destroyed. In some cases like "Polymerization," one of the monsters on your opponent's side of the field may be used in the Fusion and would then leave an open space. Your opponent performing a Ritual Summon might offer a monster on their side of the field as a Tribute and would then have an open Monster Zone space to Special Summon the Ritual Monster. (They might even use your “Ojama Tokens” to help pay for the Ritual, since this Tribute would not be for a Tribute Summon) It can be situational. Curtis Schultz, 01/13/2004

#### OMINOUS FORTUNETELLING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The opponent must reveal the randomly selected card to you after you call a type to confirm if you were right or wrong.
*   If the opponent’s hand is revealed by the effect of "Mind on Air", etc., turn his/her hand face-down and then randomly select a card.
*   If you have two copies of "Ominous Fortunetelling" on the field, you select a card and call a type for the first copy, and then select a new card and call a type again for the second copy.

#### OPTI-CAMOUFLAGE ARMOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   After you have declared a direct attack with your monster equipped with "Opti-Camouflage Armor", and then the "Opti-Camouflage Armor" is destroyed during the attack, you can no longer attack directly and a replay occurs.

#### ORCA MEGA-FORTRESS OF DARKNESS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can Tribute a face-down "Torpedo Fish" or "Cannonball Spear Shellfish" to activate "Orca Mega-Fortress of Darkness"' effect.

#### ORDEAL OF A TRAVELER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate the effect of "Ordeal of a Traveler" each time your opponent attacks.
*   You must show the card your opponent selects to your opponent.
*   If your opponent calls it right, the attack resolves normally.
*   You cannot activate "Ordeal of a Traveler"’s effect if you have no cards in your hand.
*   When "Ordeal of a Traveler" & "Fairy Box" are both active, "Fairy Box" (mandatory) is step 1 of the chain, and "Ordeal of a Traveler" (optional) is step 2.
*   When you activate "Ordeal of a Traveler"’s effect as a chain to "Magic Cylinder", since "Ordeal of a Traveler" resolves first, if your opponent guesses incorrectly then the attack does not resolve and the effect of "Magic Cylinder" disappears. If multiple copies of "Ordeal of a Traveler" are active, their effects are cumulative.

#### ORDER TO SMASH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You Tribute when you resolve "Order to Smash"'s effect.
*   You select the Spell/Trap Card when you resolve "Order to Smash"'s effect.

#### OUTSTANDING DOG MARRON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Outstanding Dog Marron" is sent to the Graveyard during a chain, its effect is activated after the current chain resolves (just like "Witch of the Black Forest").
*   When "Mystical Knight of Jackal" attacks "Outstanding Dog Marron" and destroys it, the effects are simultaneous. So "Mystical Knight of Jackal"'s effect is Step 1 of a chain and "Outstanding Dog Marron" is Step 2. "Outstanding Dog Marron" is returned to the Deck and "Mystical Knight of Jackal"'s effect disappears.

#### PAINFUL CHOICE

Netrep Rulings:

*   The player must shuffle after searching for the 5 cards to satisfy the effect of “Painful Choice.”
*   Searching for 5 cards is not a cost of activating “Painful Choice.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can I activate “Painful Choice” and “Necrovalley” and still get all 5 pieces of Exodia?  
    A: "Painful Choice" does not target a card or cards IN the Graveyard, so it is legal to activate while “Necrovalley” in on the field. “Necrovalley” does not negate the requirements for discarding to the Graveyard by cards like “Painful Choice”. bishop, 01/15/2004

#### PANDEMONIUM

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can't use "Pandemonium" to add a Fusion Monster Archfiend from the Fusion Deck to your hand, like "Fiend Skull Dragon".
*   If multiple Archfiends are destroyed at the same time by "Raigeki", you can only add 1 Archfiend from your Deck to your hand with "Pandemonium".
*   When your Archfiends controlled by your opponent are sent to your Graveyard, you can add an Archfiend from your Deck to your hand with "Pandemonium".

#### PALADIN OF WHITE DRAGON

Netrep Rulings:

*   The “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” summoned through the effect of “Paladin of White Dragon” may not attack the turn it is summoned. Any other “Blue-Eyes White Dragons” on the field may attack the same turn.

#### PANDEMONIUM WATCHBEAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your opponent activates "Huge Revolution" while your "Pandemonium Watchbear" is on your side of the field, your "Pandemonium" will not be destroyed.
*   When your "Pandemonium" is going to be destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon", you can chain "Ceasefire" to flip your "Pandemonium Watchbear" face-up, and "Pandemonium" will not be destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a Field Spell Card is played while “Pandemonium” is active, “Pandemonium” is destroyed, even if “Pandemonium Watchbear” is on the field.

#### PARASITE PARACIDE

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Parasite Paracide” is flipped and then destroyed as a result of battle, it does not go into the opponent’s deck.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a face up “Parasite Paracide” is drawn while the player has a full Monster field, what happens to the “Parasite Paracide”?  
    A: It is destroyed because there is no room on the field. bishop 02/23/2004

#### PATRICIAN OF DARKNESS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   For this card’s effect, the chosen attack target must still be legal. You cannot force a monster to attack directly if it normally cannot, or force a monster to attack a monster on its own side of the field.
*   The effect of "Patrician of Darkness" does not override the effects of "Marauding Captain", "The Legendary Fisherman", "Solar Flare Dragon", etc. You cannot choose an attack target prevented by the effects of these cards. Examples: You cannot choose "The Legendary Fisherman" as an attack target if "Umi" is on the field. You cannot choose another Warrior-Type monster as an attack target when you control "Marauding Captain".
*   "Inaba White Rabbit" must still attack your Life Points directly since it is not able to attack other monsters. You cannot force it to with this card’s effect.
*   If a monster has the optional effect of attacking directly, such as "Rainbow Flower", you may choose a monster as an attack, or a direct attack.
*   When you control "Patrician of Darkness" and a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" you must chose the equipped monster as the attack target.
*   Replays may occur as normal when this card is on the field. If, after the replay, "Patrician of Darkness" is still on the field and they choose to restart the attack, you will still choose the attack target with the effect of "Patrician of Darkness".
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness" and "Lord of D." you may still choose Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as attack targets.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If there is more than one “Patrician of Darkness” on the field, does this create a non-attacking situation?  
    A: No. Even if you have multiple "Patrician of Darkness" on your side of the field, the effect is not repeated. You will select a monster on your side of the field to be the monster your opponent will attack. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004

#### PATROID

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Patroid” targets a card.
*   If “Patroid” is flipped face-down or removed from the field, its effect is reset and you can use it again that turn if you can get it face-up on the field again.

#### PENALTY GAME!

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Penalty Game!" only requires your opponent to have 4 cards in hand when it is activated, not when it resolves. So your opponent can activate "Jar of Greed" to have 5 cards, or chain a Quick-Play Spell Card from his hand and have 3 cards, and "Penalty Game!" will still resolve.
*   If you choose the first effect, neither player can activate a card that would require the opponent to draw during their next Draw Phase, such as "Jar of Greed" or "Disturbance Strategy".
*   If the second effect of "Penalty Game!" is chosen, the opponent can still activate the effects of cards that are already face-up on the field, such as "Skull Lair" or "The Dragon’s Bead".

#### PENGUIN KNIGHT

Netrep Rulings:

*   A player’s own “Fiend Comedian” sending a player’s own “Penguin Knight” to the Graveyard will not trigger the effect of “Penguin Knight.”

#### PENGUIN SOLDIER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You may choose to return 0, 1, or 2 monsters to their owners’ hands.
*   You may target Monster Tokens, and they will be taken off the field, instead of returning to the hand.
*   Spirit Monsters can still be returned to their owners’ hands by the effect of "Penguin Soldier" even if "Spiritual Energy Settle Machine" is in play.

Netrep Rulings:

*   "Penguin Soldier's" effect DOES "specifically designate a target" for purposes of "Lord of D.," etc.
*   "Penguin Soldier" SOMETIMES "specifically designates 1 monster as a target" so for "Chaos Command Magician" or "Metalsilver Armor", if "Penguin Soldier" is targeting ONE monster then it's "specifically designating 1 monster as a target". If Penguin Soldier targets TWO monsters then it does "specifically designate a target" but it does NOT "specifically designate 1 target".

#### PENUMBRAL SOLDIER LADY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Penumbral Soldier Lady"’s ATK increases during the Damage Step and this effect can be chained to.
*   "Penbumbral Soldier Lady"’s ATK increases when appropriate, no matter whose turn it is or whether she attacked or was attacked.
*   The increase to "Penumbral Soldier Lady’s" ATK from her effect only lasts until the end of the Damage Step.

#### PETEN THE DARK CLOWN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Missing the Timing: “Peten the Dark Clown” is a “when… you can” optional Trigger Effect. This means that “Peten” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order to activate its effect.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for a Tribute Summon, the last thing that happened was that a monster was Summoned, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for “Mystik Wok” or “Cannon Soldier”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed in a chain and not as Chain Link 1, his effect does not activate. (Example: “Pot of Greed” is activated and “Ring of Destruction” is chained, targeting “Peten”.)
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed by “Cyber Jar”, the last thing that happened was that monsters were Summoned to the field, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded as a cost for “Tribe-Infecting Virus” or “Raigeki Break”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded because of “Morphing Jar” or “Card Destruction”, the last thing that happened was that both players drew cards. So the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, or by “Painful Choice”, the last thing that happened WAS that “Peten” was sent to the Graveyard, so his effect will activate.

#### PHARAOH'S TREASURE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot select the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" you just drew and sent to the Graveyard as the card to place in your hand.
*   You can select a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" in your deck as 1 of the 5 cards for "Painful Choice", but because "Painful Choice" is not a draw, the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" will not be activated.
*   If you take "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your opponent’s hand with "Exchange" and activate it, the card goes in your Deck, not the original owner’s Deck. When you draw your opponent’s "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your Deck after that, the controller gets the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" and retrieves a card from his Graveyard, but "Pharaoh’s Treasure" goes to the owner’s Graveyard.
*   If "Convulsion of Nature" is active, place "Pharaoh’s Treasure" face-down so that it is the opposite direction of the rest of the cards.
*   If a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is in your deck and "Fiber Jar" is activated, shuffle the Deck with "Pharaoh’s Treasure" in it; if you draw the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" in your new 5-card hand, the effect is activated but because there are no cards in the Graveyard to retrieve, its effect disappears.
*   If you pick up a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" because of "Cyber Jar", this is not drawing so the effect is not activated; you may Set the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" you picked up and activate it again (placing it back into your Deck, etc.).
*   You cannot activate "Seven Tools of the Bandit" or "Solemn Judgment" when "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is drawn.
*   You can select a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your Deck for "Different Dimension Capsule"; the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is removed from play and kept face-down until the time elapses, at which point it is added to your hand, but it was not drawn so its effect does not activate.
*   You can select a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your deck with "Cat of Ill Omen"; if "Necrovalley" is not on the field, the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is placed face-up on top of your Deck and will activate its effect when drawn.
*   If you have no vacant Spell and Trap Zone spaces when you draw "Pharaoh’s Treasure", you still get the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" because you don’t have to put it on the field.
*   After "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is placed face-up in the Deck, "Jinzo" will not negate its effect when drawn.
*   If "Drop Off" is used when a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is drawn, "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is discarded and its effect disappears.
*   If you draw a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" with "Graceful Charity", you miss the timing for the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" and the effect disappears. "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is simply added to your hand. In order to apply the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure", the very last action must have been to draw. You CAN apply Pharaoh’s Treasure’s effect if it is drawn while face-up due to "Pot of Greed", "Fiber Jar", etc.
*   If "Pharaoh's Treasure" is drawn from your Deck (face-up) while "Banisher of the Light" is in play, "Pharaoh's Treasure" is removed from play and its effect does not activate.
*   You select the card in your Graveyard that you wish to add to your hand when "Pharaoh's Treasure" is drawn and activates it effect, so your opponent can chain AFTER you have announced which card you wish to retrieve.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn and a discard action occurs immediately following (such as through “Graceful Charity”), the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” disappears.
*   If a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is revealed, but not drawn, the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” disappears.
*   If “Drop Off” is chained to the effect of a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure,” the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will disappear.
*   If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is face up in a player’s deck when the effect of “Fiber Jar” resolves, that “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will remain face up in that player’s deck. If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn as a result of “Fiber Jar’s” effect, “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will be sent to the Graveyard, but because there are no other cards, the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will disappear.
*   An active “Jinzo” on the field will not prevent the resolution of a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure.”

#### PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot target a face-up non-Continuous, non-Equip Spell or Trap Card. This is because they are already “considered to be destroyed” once they are activated (even though they are not sent to the Graveyard until the chain resolves). If you target a face-down Spell or Trap Card, the opponent can activate it as a chain. If it is not Continuous, it will not be returned to the top of the Deck. It will be placed in the Graveyard after the chain resolves, as normal.
*   You can activate “Phoenix Wing Wind Blast” and target a face-up “Swords of Revealing Light” because it destroys itself by its own effect, instead of being destroyed when activated, like most Normal Spell Cards.

#### PHYSICAL DOUBLE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Physical Double" during the Damage Step.
*   If you activate "Physical Double" and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy his targeted monster, the effect of "Physical Double" disappears.
*   You can target a Monster Token with "Physical Double" to create a Mirage Token copy of it.
*   When the targeted monster's Level, Attribute, etc. are changed after "Physical Double" resolves, the stats of the Mirage Token are not changed. When the targeted monster's Level, Attribute, etc., are changed before "Physical Double" resolves, the changed stats are adopted by the Mirage Token.
*   If a Field Spell Card was active before resolution of "Physical Double" that applied to the targeted monster, it applies to the original monster and to the Mirage Token. So if a Field Spell Card was increasing ATK by +500, the original would get +500 ATK and the Mirage Token would get an additional +500 ATK, for a +1000 ATK bonus total for the Mirage Token over the printed ATK of the original monster. Likewise, when "A Legendary Ocean" is active, and you activate "Physical Double" targeting a WATER monster, the Mirage Token's Level Stars are 2 fewer than the printed Level Stars of the original targeted monster.

#### PIKERU'S CIRCLE OF ENCHANTMENT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This effect lasts until the end of the End Phase.

#### PIKERU'S SECOND SIGHT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card’s effect lasts until the end of your opponent’s second End Phase after this card was activated.
*   The opponent shows you all drawn cards, even if they are drawn by a card effect.

#### PINCH HOPPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Missing the Timing: Because the effect of "Pinch Hopper" effect is an optional “when… you can” Trigger Effect, "Pinch Hopper" being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate its effect. So if you Tribute "Pinch Hopper" for a Tribute Summon, you cannot activate the effect of “Pinch Hopper” because the last thing to happen will be the Summoning of the Tribute monster. Also, if you Tribute “Pinch Hopper” for “Cannon Soldier”, the very last thing that happened will be the 500 points of damage inflicted to your opponent, so the effect of “Pinch Hopper” will not activate.
*   If you offer "Pinch Hopper" as a Tribute to attack with "Insect Queen", you can resolve "Pinch Hopper"'s effect after attack declaration.
*   When your opponent controls your "Pinch Hopper" and "Pinch Hopper" is sent to the Graveyard, "Pinch Hopper"'s effect does not activate.

#### PINEAPPLE BLAST

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Ring of Destruction" or "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Pineapple Blast", and the number of monsters on the field is changed, count the number of monsters at resolution of "Pineapple Blast"'s effect, not at activation.
*   If, when "Pineapple Blast" resolves, you have no monsters, all of your opponent's monsters are destroyed too.
*   If you Summon a monster and want to activate "Pineapple Blast", and your opponent wants to use "Trap Hole", "Pineapple Blast" is Step 1 of the chain and "Trap Hole" is Step 2.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Pineapple Blast” cannot be activated if the player summoning “Marauding Captain” chooses to use the Special Summoning effect of “Marauding Captain.”

#### PIRANHA ARMY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Battle Damage doubled by "Piranha Army"'s effect is still considered Battle Damage (not effect damage).

#### PITCH-BLACK POWER STONE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You place the 3 Spell Counters on "Pitch-Black Power Stone" even if "Royal Decree" is active, so if your opponent chains "Royal Decree" to your "Pitch-Black Power Stone", or chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Jinzo", you still get 3 Spell Counters on it.
*   "Pitch-Black Power Stone"'s transfer effect targets.
*   "Pitch-Black Power Stone" may itself receive additional Spell Counters from effects such as "Apprentice Magician".
*   You can use a Spell Counter from a card like "Breaker the Magical Warrior" and replace "Breaker the Magical Warrior"'s Spell Counter with "Pitch-Black Power Stone" on the same turn (and use "Breaker the Magical Warrior"'s effect again that same turn, if you wish).
*   If you have multiple "Pitch-Black Power Stones", each can transfer 1 of its Spell Counters per turn.
*   If you have 1 Spell Counter left on "Pitch-Black Power Stone", and your opponent activates "Mystical Space Typhoon", and you chain the transferring effect of "Pitch-Black Power Stone" (a Spell Speed 2 effect), first the transfer effect resolves and the Spell Counter is moved, then "Pitch-Black Power Stone" is immediately destroyed before "Mystical Space Typhoon" resolves.

#### PITCH-BLACK WARWOLF

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this monster makes the opponent of this monster’s current controller unable to activate Trap Cards during the Battle Phase. If you take control of your opponent’s monster with "Change of Heart" during your turn, your opponent cannot activate Trap Cards during your Battle Phase, but you can.
*   The effect of this monster makes your opponent unable to activate Set Trap Cards. However, your opponent can still activate the effects of face-up Trap Cards such as "Type Zero Magic Crusher", "Ultimate Offering", "Skull Lair", "The Dragon’s Bead", and "Astral Barrier".

#### POISON DRAW FROG

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If “Poison Draw Frog” is destroyed by “Acid Trap Hole”, you can draw 1 card.
*   When a face-up “Poison Draw Frog” equipped to “Relinquished” is sent to the Graveyard, you can draw 1 card.

#### POISON FANGS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against the damage caused by "Poison Fangs", since it is a Continuous Spell Card.

#### POLE POSITION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The second effect of "Pole Position" does not begin a chain. When "Pole Position" is removed from the field, the effect is applied immediately and the monster is destroyed.
*   If "Pole Position" is active, and your opponent controls "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and "Skull Servant", and you activate "Smashing Ground", "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of "Smashing Ground" disappears.
*   If you control "Dark Magician" and your opponent controls "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", and you activate "Flint" targeting "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", and your opponent chains "Pole Position", then "Flint" is equipped meaninglessly to "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". If "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is destroyed, "Flint" can be equipped to "Dark Magician" meaninglessly if you choose (even if other monsters are on the field).
*   If "Level Limit - Area B" and "Pole Position" are on the field, the highest ATK monster is unaffected by "Level Limit - Area B". If it attacks, and during damage calculation "Mask of Weakness" is activated to reduce its ATK so that it is no longer the highest ATK monster on the field, the effect of "Level Limit - Area B" is applied. Also, the attack stops. Do not perform damage calculation.
*   You cannot choose to Summon a monster, Set a monster, or Set or activate a Spell or Trap Card, or card effect, if it would cause an infinite loop. If you do this by mistake, just rewind the game to before the Summon/Set/activation occurred.

*   EXAMPLE #1: I have "Pole Position", "Luminous Spark" (+500 to LIGHT), and "Gemini Elf" (1900 ATK / EARTH) face-up on the field. “Gemini Elf” is the monster on the field with the highest ATK, so it is unaffected by Spell Cards. If the opponent Summons "X-Head Cannon" (1800 ATK / LIGHT), “Luminous Spark” will raise the ATK of “X-Head Cannon” to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field, so it’s unaffected by Spell Cards, so it drops to 1800 ATK, then increases to 2300, then drops to 1800, etc. This would create an infinite loop. Therefore, the opponent cannot Summon “X-Head Cannon”.
*   EXAMPLE #2: The opponent has "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000 ATK) and “Pole Position” face-up on the field. I have "Gemini Elf" (1900 ATK), and an "Opticlops" (1800 ATK) equipped with "Axe of Despair"(+1000 ATK; 2800 total) face-up on the field, and a Set "Ring of Destruction". If I activate "Ring of Destruction" to destroy "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", then “Opticlops” will be the highest ATK monster on the field, and cause an infinite loop (it is the highest, it isn’t, it is, it isn’t, etc.). Therefore, I cannot target “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” with “Ring of Destruction”.
*   EXAMPLE #3: The opponent has a face-down "Pole Position". I have "Opticlops" (1800 ATK) and "Gemini Elf" (1900 ATK) face-up on the field. I activate "Axe of Despair" (+1000 ATK) and try to equip my "Opticlops" (1800 ATK). The opponent cannot chain "Pole Position", since that would cause an infinite loop. “Pole Position” is an illegal activation. Put it back face-down.
*   EXAMPLE #4: I have "Pole Position", "Blade Knight" (1600 ATK / LIGHT), and "Luminous Spark" (+500 ATK to LIGHT) face-up on the field and 2 cards in my hand. The opponent has "Giant Orc" (2200 ATK / EARTH) face-up on the field, which is the highest-ATK monster on the field. If I Set 1 of the 2 cards in my hand, “Blade Knight” gains +400 ATK with its effect, becomes the highest-ATK monster, and because of “Luminous Spark” an infinite loop is created. So I am not allowed to Set a card.
*   If an infinite loop is caused because of game mechanics and not by a player’s voluntary card play, “Pole Position” will be destroyed. When “Pole Position” is destroyed in this way, no monster on the field is destroyed by the effect of "Pole Position".
*   EXAMPLE #5: I have "Pole Position" and "Opticlops" (1800 ATK) face-up on the field. The opponent has a "Muka Muka" equipped with "Axe of Despair" face-up on the field with no cards in his hand. At the start of the opponent's turn, he draws a card, making "Muka Muka"s ATK 1900. An infinite loop is created by something that could not be avoided, so “Pole Position” is destroyed.
*   EXAMPLE #6: The opponent has “Blade Knight” (1600 ATK) equipped with “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” (+300 ATK; 1900 ATK total) and 2 cards in hand, along with “Marauding Captain” (1200 ATK). The turn player has “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Pole Position”, and “Giant Orc” (2200 ATK). The turn player attacks “Marauding Captain” with “Giant Orc”, inflicting 1000 points of damage. The opponent has to discard a card because of “Robbin’ Goblin” and an infinite loop is created because “Blade Knight” now fluctuates between 2300 and 2000 ATK (either above or below “Giant Orc”, making it the strongest monster on the field… or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.
*   EXAMPLE #7: I have "Pole Position", "Banner of Courage", and "Opticlops" face-up on the field. The opponent has "Gemini Elf" face-up on the field. When I enter my Battle Phase, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2000 ATK. So “Pole Position” is destroyed.
*   EXAMPLE #8: I have "Pole Position", "Gemini Elf" (1900 ATK / EARTH) and "Mystic Plasma Zone" (+500 ATK to DARK) face-up on the field, and an "Opticlops" (1800 ATK / DARK) in face-down Defense Position. The opponent attacks my face-down "Opticlops" with "Mokey Mokey". When we flip "Opticlops" face-up in the Damage Step, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2300 ATK (either above or below “Gemini Elf”, making it the strongest monster on the field, or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.

#### POSSESSED DARK SOUL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the opponent has more Level 3 or lower monsters on the field than you have empty Monster Card Zones after you Tribute this card (the Zone it occupied is now empty), you choose which ones to gain control of and the rest are destroyed. If you choose to destroy "Griggle" or "Ameba" in this manner, their effects do not activate since they never came to your side of the field.
*   You cannot gain control of face-down monsters with this card’s effect, so the opponent may chain "Book of Moon" selecting a Level 3 or lower monster and they will keep control of it.
*   You maintain control of the monsters until they are removed from the field.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If there are more level 3 or lower monsters on the opponent’s field than there is space on the player’s field when “Possessed Dark Soul” is Tributed for its effect, the excess monsters are destroyed.
*   If a monster is reduced to Level 3 or lower by the effect of “Demotion,” and control is taken by the effect of “Possessed Dark Soul,” control will not return to the other player if “Demotion” becomes inactive.

#### POT OF GENEROSITY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You return cards to the Deck when you resolve the effect (it’s not a cost).
*   You cannot activate “Pot of Generosity” if you have only 1 card in your hand besides “Pot of Generosity”.
*   If an effect is chained to “Pot of Generosity” so that you only have 1 or 0 cards in your hand, the effect of “Pot of Generosity” disappears. Do not return cards to the Deck and do not shuffle.
*   You can chain “Serial Spell” to “Pot of Generosity”, but you will have no hand so both effects will disappear.

#### POWER BOND

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” lasts as long as the Fusion Monster is face-up on the field. If it is flipped face-down or removed from the field, the ATK increase disappears.
*   The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” is not a fixed number. It is a bonus equal to the original ATK. So if the original ATK changes, so does the bonus from “Power Bond”. For example, if you equip the Fusion Monster with “Megamorph” to change the original ATK, the bonus ATK for “Power Bond” adjusts so that the bonus is equal to the new original ATK. For example, if you Summon “Cyber End Dragon” and then equip it with “Megamorph” while your Life Points are lower, its original ATK will become 8000, so it gains an additional 8000 ATK from “Power Bond” for 16000 ATK total.
*   You cannot use “Barrel Behind the Door” against the damage from “Power Bond” because the damage happens much later than the activation of the “Power Bond” card.
*   Even if the Fusion Monster is removed from the field or flipped face-down, you cannot negate the effect of “Power Bond” and the player will still take damage equal to the original ATK.
*   The damage you take because of “Power Bond” is equal to the original ATK of the Fusion Monster at the time the monster is Special Summoned. If the Fusion Monster has its original ATK changed, this does not affect the damage inflicted by “Power Bond”.
*   If you Fusion Summon “UFOroid Fighter” with 3000 ATK, and then later in the turn “Skill Drain” is activated, reducing its ATK to 0, you will still take 3000 points of damage during the End Phase. If you send “UFOroid Fighter” to the Graveyard so that its effect resets and its original ATK becomes zero, you still take damage equal to its original ATK at the time it was Special Summoned by “Power Bond”.
*   You can prevent the damage from “Power Bond” with “Des Wombat”.
*   If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active and “Power Bond” is used to Special Summon a Fusion Monster that has no effect, the Fusion Monster will not gain the ATK bonus from “Power Bond”, but the controller will still take damage for “Power Bond” (because the player is not a non-Effect Monster Card).

#### PRECIOUS CARDS FROM BEYOND

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can't use your "Precious Cards from Beyond" when your opponent offers 2 monsters as a Tribute, only when you do.
*   "Precious Cards from Beyond" is only for a Tribute Summon or Set, not for a Ritual Summon or Special Summon like "Lava Golem".
*   If you Tribute Summon "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" for 1 Tribute using "Cost Down", you can't activate "Precious Cards from Beyond"'s effect.
*   If you have multiple "Precious Cards from Beyond", you can activate each of their effects when you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 or more Tributes.
*   If you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 monsters, and 1 of them was your opponent's monster that you used with "Change of Heart" or "Soul Exchange", you can activate "Precious Cards from Beyond".

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can the effect of “Precious Cards from Beyond” be used when summoning “Lava Golem” to the opponent’s side of the field?  
    A: The effect of "Lava Golem" is not a Tribute Summon. It will not work with the effect of "Precious Cards from Beyond." Tribute Summons are Normal Summons of 5+ Level Star monsters by offering Tributes. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004

#### PREMATURE BURIAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Tailor of the Fickle" selecting "Premature Burial" as a target.
*   You cannot activate "Fairy’s Hand Mirror" to make your opponent chose a different monster when they activate "Premature Burial".
*   If you activate this card and your opponent chains "Imperial Order" the effect of "Premature Burial" is negated and the Special Summon never occurs, but you still pay 800 Life Points. If "Imperial Order" is activated after "Premature Burial" is already on the field, the equipped monster is NOT destroyed and "Premature Burial" remains on the field meaninglessly. If "Premature Burial" is then destroyed while "Imperial Order" is still active, the monster remains on the field, but if the monster is destroyed, "Premature Burial" is also destroyed, since it is still equipped to that monster.
*   If the equipped monster is flipped face-down "Premature Burial" is destroyed but the monster is not destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   "Premature Burial" is a targeting effect targeting a card in the Graveyard.
*   An already active “Premature Burial” is not negated when a “Necrovalley” is newly activated.

#### PREPARE TO STRIKE BACK

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Prepare to Strike Back” can be chained to.
*   The damage from “Prepare to Strike Back” is effect damage, not battle damage.
*   “Prepare to Strike Back” does not target.
*   If an effect is chained to “Prepare to Strike Back” that flips the monster face-down, the effect of “Prepare to Strike Back” is not applied.

#### PRICKLE FAIRY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Prickle Fairy" is changed to an Insect-Type monster with "DNA Surgery", your opponent cannot attack.
*   Netrep Rulings:
*   If “Prickle Fairy” is turned to Insect-Type and there are only face up Insect-Type monsters on the player’s field, the opponent may not attack unless the attacker can inherently attack directly.
*   If a face-down Insect Type is attacked while “Prickle Fairy” is face up and active on the field, Damage Calculation will proceed normally.

#### PRIMAL SEED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Primal Seed" can add cards to your hand that were removed from play face-up ("Dimensionhole") or face-down ("Different Dimension Capsule").
*   You target the 2 removed cards when you activate "Primal Seed".
*   If you don't have 2 or more cards removed from play, you cannot activate "Primal Seed".
*   A Fusion Monster selected with "Primal Seed" returns to the Fusion Deck.
*   The required card only needs to be face-up on the field. It does not need to be a Monster Card, so if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” is equipped to “Relinquished”, you can activate “Primal Seed”.

#### PRINCESS OF TSURUGI

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Princess of Tsurugi’s” effect is considered one "burst" of Damage.

#### PROHIBITION

Netrep Rulings:

*   A card declared by "Prohibition" may not be Normal Set, Normal Summoned, or activated.
*   A card declared by "Prohibition" may be Special Summoned, but will have no effect and may not attack.
*   Monster cards chosen by the effect of "Prohibition" may not be Set.
*   “Prohibition” will not prevent an instant win through the effect of “Exodia the Forbidden One.”
*   If a “Prohibition” that declares “Jinzo” is negated by “Imperial Order”, “Jinzo” may be Summoned.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Prohibition” has been activated and “Spirit Message ‘L’” is selected, will that prevent “Destiny Board” from completing the message?  
    A: “Prohibition” would not stop the “Spirit Message ‘L’” from being placed onto the field by the effect of “Destiny Board.” Curtis Schultz, 04/07/2004
*   Q: Does “Prohibition” only affect the field? (“Kuriboh”/”Thunder Dragon” never reach the field)  
    A: “Prohibition” prevents the named card from being played. Activating the effect of “Thunder Dragon” or “Kuriboh” would be playing it. Curtis Schultz, 04/21/2004
*   Q: If my opponent already has Set the card declared with “Prohibition,” can he activate the card?  
    A: Yes they can. Prohibited cards that were Set on the field before “Prohibition” resolved can still be activated. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004
*   Q: If my opponent plays “Monster Reborn” on the card declared with “Prohibition,” that is not considered “playing it” right?  
    A: Right, but if the Monster Card is an Effect Monster Card, it will have no effect AND the monster would not be able to attack \[or change its battle position\]. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004

#### PROTECTOR OF THE SANCTUARY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Your opponent cannot draw with "Airknight Parshath" while you control "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   Most cards that would cause the opponent to draw outside of the Draw Phase, such as "Card Destruction", cannot be activated, even by the controller of "Protector of the Sanctuary". However, effects that are forcibly activated, like "Morphing Jar", can be activated (but results may vary; see below).
*   If "Protector of the Sanctuary" is on the field, then Flip Effects like "Morphing Jar" will still activate because they must activate when the monster is flipped (whether it was Flip Summoned, flipped by an attack, or flipped by "Book of Taiyou", etc.).
*   If "Morphing Jar"'s effect activates, then both players discard their hands, but if you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent does not draw a new hand.
*   You cannot activate cards if they make your opponent draw, such as "Dragged Down Into the Grave", "Card Destruction", or "Disturbance Strategy".
*   "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents your opponent from drawing with "Mirage of Nightmare". However, your opponent can still activate "Mirage of Nightmare", "Appropriate", etc., even though he cannot use their effects at that time.
*   If you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent cannot activate "Super Rejuvenation", "Jar Robber", "Monster Recovery", or "Reload" outside of the Draw Phase.
*   If you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent CAN activate "Reload", "Jar of Greed", "Reckless Greed", etc., during the Draw Phase (either player's).
*   If you have "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent can activate cards like "Gamble" that are random as to whether he can draw, but he cannot draw even if he wins the coin toss.
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to a card effect that would make your opponent draw, and if you Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent does not draw.
*   If you have "Protector of the Sanctuary" and your "Bistro Butcher" inflicts damage to your opponent, your opponent doesn't draw.
*   You cannot activate "Heavy Slump" while you control a face-up "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Reckless Greed" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw for the effect of "Reckless Greed" because of the "Protector of the Sanctuary", so you do not draw and you do not skip 2 Draw Phases.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Disturbance Strategy" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles it by the effect of "Disturbance Strategy", but "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents him from drawing.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Upstart Goblin" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw 1 card and your opponent does not gain 1000 Life Points.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Reload" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to his Deck and shuffles it, but "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents him from drawing.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Graceful Charity" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw for the effect of "Graceful Charity" and you do not discard 2 cards.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Mind Wipe" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles, but cannot draw any cards.

#### PYRAMID ENERGY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "Pyramid Energy" during the Damage Step.
*   The effect of "Pyramid Energy" is not applied to monsters summoned after "Pyramid Energy"’s resolution.

#### PYRAMID TURTLE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You may Special Summon a high-level monster with "Pyramid Turtle"'s effect (like "Vampire Lord" or "Ryu Kokki"), but not a Special-Summon only monster (like "Spirit of the Pharaoh").

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a player activates “Creature Swap”, gives their opponent “Pyramid Turtle”, and then destroys the “Pyramid Turtle” in battle, will the player be able to attack with the Special Summoned monster from “Pyramid Turtle’s” effect?  
    A: Yes, in the situation presented the Zombie-Type monster Special Summoned by the effect of "Pyramid Turtle" may attack during that same Battle Phase. Curtis Schultz, 02/15/2004

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

*   Q: If "Newdoria" and "Pyramid Turtle" crash or destroy each other in battle can "Newdoria" destroy the monster summoned off of "Pyramid Turtle"?  
    A: No. "Newdoria" is a mandatory effect and "Pyramid Turtle" is an optional effect so "Newdoria" will be chain link 1 regardless of who turn player is. Newdoria must target at activation. So the target to be destroyed "Newdoria" will need to be chosen before the effect of pyramid turtle activates.

#### PYRO CLOCK OF DESTINY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only use "Pyro Clock of Destiny" to advance the turn count by 1 for "Swords of Revealing Light", "Lightforce Sword", or "Final Countdown".

#### RAGING FLAME SPRITE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The +1000 ATK lasts as long as "Raging Flame Sprite" remains face-up on the field. "Raging Flame Sprite" can continue to get +1000 ATK each time it successfully attacks directly (becoming ATK 1100, then ATK 2100, etc.).
*   The effect of "Raging Flame Sprite" is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   The effect of "Raging Flame Sprite" is resolved after damage calculation and before Flip Effects are resolved (so the timing is the same as "Don Zaloog" and "Airknight Parshath").
*   If "Raging Flame Sprite" is equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce", its ATK will increase by 1000 points after each successful attack ("Raging Flame Sprite" must still deal at least 1 point of damage with each attack for its effect to apply). So the second attack will be with +1000 ATK, and it will gain another +1000 ATK after the completion of the second attack.

#### RAIGEKI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If there are no monsters on your opponent’s side of the field you may not activate "Raigeki".

#### RARE METALMORPH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you chain "Rare Metalmorph" to an effect like "Snatch Steal" that targets a monster, "Snatch Steal" is equipped but its effect is negated while "Rare Metalmorph" is active.
*   If a monster targeted by "Rare Metalmorph" is flipped face-down, it is no longer targeted by "Rare Metalmorph" and "Rare Metalmorph" remains on the field meaninglessly.

#### RAREGOLD ARMOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Raregold Armor" & "Metalsilver Armor" only apply their effects when the same player controls the Equip Spell Card and the monster it is equipped to; you can equip these cards to a monster controlled by your opponent but the effect is not active.
*   If you have 2 monsters equipped with "Raregold Armor", then your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have a Warrior-Type monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", and "Marauding Captain", your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have an Amazoness equipped with "Raregold Armor", and "Amazoness Tiger", your opponent cannot attack.
*   "Ring of Magnetism" 'trumps' "Raregold Armor", "Amazoness Tiger", and "Marauding Captain". So if you have a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", and a monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" is the target of attacks.
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness" and have a monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", you can only re-direct attacks to the monster equipped with "Raregold Armor" as it is the only legal target.

#### RAY OF HOPE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can't activate "Ray of Hope" if you don't have 2 LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard.

#### READY FOR INTERCEPTING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Ready for Intercepting" after your opponent’s attack declaration to flip face-down the monster which is being attacked, a replay does not occur. Complete the attack as normal. (This must happen during the Battle Step, not the Damage Step.)
*   If you activate "Ready for Intercepting" and target the attacking monster, it is flipped into face-down Defense Position and the attack ends. (This must happen during the Battle Step, not the Damage Step.)
*   While the effect of "Light of Intervention" is active, you cannot activate "Ready for Intercepting".
*   If you chain "Ready for Intercepting" to "Hammer Shot" to flip a monster face-down, that monster will not be included in determining which monster is destroyed by the effect of "Hammer Shot".

#### REAPER OF THE CARDS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card can destroy a Trap Card on either side of the field. So if your opponent has no Trap Cards and no Set Spell or Trap Cards, you must destroy a card on your side of the field. If it is face-down Spell Card you must reveal it to your opponent, and it is not destroyed.

#### REASONING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Pick up cards until you pick up a monster that can be Normal Summoned.
*   You can Special Summon a high-level monster like "Dark Magician" with "Reasoning", but not Special Summon-only monsters like "Gate Guardian", Ritual Monsters, etc.
*   If you pick up a Spirit Monster, then all picked up cards are sent to the Graveyard.
*   If no monster is picked up, shuffle your Deck and put it back in the Deck Zone; the effect of "Reasoning" disappears.
*   You cannot activate "Reasoning" if you already activated "Scapegoat" this turn.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is Special Summoned with "Reasoning", the other cards picked up for "Reasoning" are sent to the Graveyard. The effect of "Banisher of the Light" is not applied until after "Reasoning" resolves.

#### RECKLESS GREED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Reckless Greed" is activated, causing you to skip your next 2 Draw phases, and you also must skip your Draw Phase due to another effect such as "Offerings to the Doomed", the skipped Phases do not accumulate. So if you activate "Reckless Greed" and "Offerings to the Doomed", you only skip 2 Draw Phases.
*   Skipping a Draw Phase is an effect, not a cost, so if "Reckless Greed" is negated you do not skip your Draw Phases.

#### RECYCLE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you meet the condition enough times, you can activate "Recycle" as many times as you want in the same Standby Phase.
*   You cannot activate "Recycle" if you have no non-Monster Cards in your Graveyard.

#### RED-EYES B. CHICK

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Ignition Effects on monsters cannot be activated while the Effect Monster is face-down. So this face-down monster cannot be Tributed for its own effect.
*   If you take control of your opponent’s "Red-Eyes B. Chick", you can activate its effect. In this case, the "Red-Eyes B. Chick" is sent to your opponent’s Graveyard, but you get to Special Summon "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" from your hand.

#### RED-EYES BLACK METAL DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and must be Special Summoned from the Deck by the condition written on the card. It CANNOT be Special Summoned from your hand. So once it is in your hand, there is no way to Summon this card.

#### RED-MOON BABY

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Red-Moon Baby’s” effect only applies if the monster it destroys is in the Graveyard at the end of the Battle Phase.

#### REFLECT BOUNDER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, then damage calculation is applied normally, then "Reflect Bounder" is destroyed by its own effect.
*   When an Attack Position "Reflect Bounder" is attacked, it is destroyed by its own effect even if the ATK of "Reflect Bounder" is lower than the ATK of the attacking monster.
*   The damage inflicted by "Reflect Bounder"'s effect is not Battle Damage, so it cannot be reduced to 0 with "Waboku".
*   Effects such as "Metalmorph" and "Injection Fairy Lily" happen after "Reflect Bounder"'s effect, because "Reflect Bounder"'s effect happens before damage calculation.
*   When your opponent attacks your Attack Position "Reflect Bounder", your opponent can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Reflect Bounder"'s effect.
*   When your opponent's "White Magical Hat" with "Axe of Despair" attacks your "Reflect Bounder", "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is performed, and "White Magical Hat"'s effect is activated.
*   When "Reflect Bounder" is attacked by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is applied, "Reflect Bounder" is determined to be destroyed as a result of battle, "Dark Ruler Ha Des" negates "Reflect Bounder"'s effect, and "Reflect Bounder" does not destroy itself with its own effect, however it was still destroyed as a result of battle.
*   "Reflect Bounder"'s effect does not target.
*   If "Reflect Bounder" is attacked by "D. D. Warrior Lady", and the effect of "Reflect Bounder" is activated, "Reflect Bounder" inflicts damage, damage calculation is performed, and "Reflect Bounder" destroys itself with its own effect and is sent to the Graveyard, so even if "D. D. Warrior Lady" activates her effect, "Reflect Bounder" is not removed from play because it is already in the Graveyard.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is in Face Down Attack position through the effect of “Darkness Approaches” will its effect activate when it is attacked?  
    A: "Reflect Bounder's" effect will activate after it is flipped face-up by the attack. "Reflect Bounder" is flipped face-up before damage calculation. That is why its effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004
*   Q: If the opponent declares an attack on “Reflect Bounder” while in Defense Position and the player activates “Final Attack Orders”, will the effect of “Reflect Bounder” activate?  
    A: The effect of "Reflect Bounder" would activate. This is because it is changed to Attack Position by the effect of "Final Attack Orders" after being flipped by the attack. This all occurs before damage calculation. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004
*   Q: “Necrovalley” is face up on my side of the field. I attack my opponents face up “Reflect Bounder” with my “Gravekeeper’s Assailant”. I use “Gravekeeper’s Assailant’s” effect to change “Reflect Bounder” to defense mode. Now, do I take 2000 damage from “Reflect Bounder’s” effect, or since I changed it to defense mode, “Reflect Bounder” is destroyed by “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” taking no damage?  
    A: The effect of "Gravekeeper's Assailant" activates when you declare the attack. This is during the Battle Step. If you target "Reflect Bounder" with the "Gravekeeper's Assailant's" effect and it resolves properly, "Reflect Bounder" will be shifted to Defense Position. Then you would enter the Damage Step. Since "Reflect Bounder" is now in Defense Position, its effect will not activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/04/2004
*   Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is chosen to remain on the field for the effect of “Last Turn,” will it inflict damage to the other player?  
    A: The turn player is the one who is attacking when “Last Turn” resolves. If the person that activated “Last Turn” controls a “Reflect Bounder,” the “Reflect Bounder’s” effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/15/2004

*   You cannot use “Re-Fusion” to Special Summon a Fusion Monster that was Summoned with “Magical Scientist”, or otherwise not properly Fusion Summoned.
*   You can chain to the first part of this card’s effect. However, the last part (that destroys the monster) does not start a chain.

#### REGENERATING MUMMY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Regenerating Mummy"'s effect will activate when sent to the Graveyard by the effect of "Morphing Jar" or "Card Destruction".
*   "Regenerating Mummy"'s effect will activate during the Damage Step because of "Spirit Reaper" or "Don Zaloog".
*   "Regenerating Mummy"'s effect will activate when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard because of "Chain Destruction".
*   You can chain to "Regenerating Mummy"'s effect.
*   You cannot use the same "Regenerating Mummy" for both parts of "Delinquent Duo"'s effect.

#### REINFORCEMENT OF THE ARMY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You must reveal the monster you select with this card’s effect to your opponent before placing it in your hand.
*   You can activate this card even if you have no Level 4 or lower Warrior-Type monsters remaining in your Deck, but you must let your opponent see your Deck to confirm. Shuffle your Deck afterwards.

#### REINFORCEMENTS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You choose the monster to receive the ATK increase when you activate this card. This card targets.
*   If you activate two "Reinforcements" on the same monster, its ATK increases by 1000.

#### RELEASE RESTRAINT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you do not have any copies of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” in your hand or Deck, you can still activate this card to Tribute “Gearfried the Iron Knight”, but you will need to show your cards to your opponent to confirm.

#### RELINQUISHED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Relinquished"’s effect to equip itself with a monster can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2 since it is a Ignition Effect.
*   A monster equipped to "Relinquished" occupies a Spell & Trap Zone of the controller of "Relinquished". So if you already have 5 Spell & Trap Cards on the field you cannot activate the effect of "Relinquished". Any Equip Spell Cards equipped to the selected monster are destroyed. "Relinquished" gains the ATK and DEF of the monster equipped to it, but not the effects of an Effect Monster.
*   The selected monster is treated as a Monster Card when it is sent to the Graveyard, so the effects of "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest" would activate, but the effect of "Mystic Tomato" would not, since it was not destroyed as a result of battle.
*   You can not voluntarily destroy a monster equipped to "Relinquished" but you can use "Mystical Space Typhoon" or "Emergency Provisions" to eliminate it.
*   "Relinquished" will only inflict its effect damage to your opponent if "Relinquished" would be destroyed as a result of battle and the equipped Monster Card is destroyed instead. When this occurs you inflict damage to your opponent equal to the Battle Damage that the controller of "Relinquished" received; this is the ONLY time "Relinquished" will deal effect damage. (If "Relinquished", equipped with a 1800 ATK monster, attack a 3000 DEF Defense Position monster, "Relinquished’s" controller takes 1200 damage but "Relinquished" does not inflict effect damage to the opponent.)
*   You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against Trigger Effects like "Lava Golem", "Giant Germ", "Relinquished" (when it inflicts effect damage, since "Barrel Behind the Door" can be activated during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap Card), "Minar" (when discarded), "Parasite Paracide" (when it inflicts effect damage), "Bowganian", "Mushroom Man #2", "Reflect Bounder" (when it is attacked), "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" (when it attacks and destroys a Defense Position monster and sends it to the Graveyard), "Granadora" (when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard), "Balloon Lizard" (when destroyed), "KA-2 Des Scissors", "Needle Burrower", "Atomic Firefly", "Elephant Statue of Disaster", and "Ameba".
*   Your opponent cannot target your "Blindly Loyal Goblin" with the effect of "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict".
*   While "Gorgon’s Eye" is active, if "Relinquished" equipped with a monster is in Defense Position, the effect of "Relinquished" is negated, it can no longer be equipped with a monster, and the Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with "Snatch Steal", etc., and you activate "Relinquished"'s effect on your next turn to equip the monster to "Relinquished", and your opponent chains "Remove Brainwashing" to "Relinquished"'s effect, control of the monster returns to you before "Relinquished"'s effect resolves and, since you cannot use "Relinquished"'s effect on monsters on your side of the field, "Relinquished"'s effect disappears.
*   Monsters equipped to "Relinquished" while "Skill Drain" is active are negated and destroyed because "Relinquished" no longer has an effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and "Relinquished"'s ATK and DEF are returned to normal.
*   While the effect of "Timidity" is active, you cannot destroy a face-down Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished".
*   "Token Thanksgiving" will destroy a Monster Token equipped to "Relinquished".

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Relinquished” may equip itself with one monster at a time per turn.
*   “Relinquished’s” equipping effect is a targeting effect.

Judge List Rulings:

*   A face-down card equipped to "Relinquished"/"Thousand-Eyes Restrict" is a legal target for "Nobleman of Extermination." Curtis Schultz, 03/09/2005
*   A face-down card equipped to "Relinquished"/"Thousand-Eyes Restrict" will be returned to its owner's hand by "Byser Shock's" effect. Curtis Schultz, 03/09/2005

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

- Q: If I summon "Relinquished" and use its effect, what happens if my opponent chains a card that would flip-down or remove "Relinquished" from the field?  
A: For this example, say you declare the effect of "Relinquished" and your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to the effect. "Relinquished" would be chain link 1 and "Book of Moon" would be chain link 2. In Yu-Gi-Oh! chains always resolve backwards. "Book of Moon" will resolve first, flipping down "Relinquished". "Relinquished" needs to be face up on the field to attach a monster to itself, so its effect will "fizzle" and the targeted monster will remain on the field. This applies to cards such as (but not limited to) "Book of Moon", "Ring of Destruction", and "Compulsory Evacuation Device".

#### RELOAD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have your opponent's card in your hand and activate "Reload", your opponent's card is shuffled to his/her Deck.
*   Your opponent can activate "Appropriate" in response to your drawing with "Reload"'s effect.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Reload” is chained to the activation of “Drop Off,” the effect of “Drop Off” disappears.

#### REMOVE BRAINWASHING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Remove Brainwashing" is activated, monsters like "Lava Golem" & "Parasite Paracide" will return to their owner's side of the field, monsters revived with "Monster Reborn" return to their owner's side of the field, monsters taken with "Exchange" and played normally return to their owner's side of the field, etc.
*   When "Remove Brainwashing" is already active on the field and a switching effect is activated, or "Remove Brainwashing" is chained to a switching effect and is thus active before the switching effect resolves, control switches due to the effect but then switches back to the original owner because of "Remove Brainwashing". So for "Creature Swap", control is changed but then control goes back to the original owners. This means that if you give control of "Griggle" or "Ameba" to your opponent, their effect IS activated even though "Griggle"/"Ameba" then returns to the original owner's control afterwards.
*   If "Monster Reborn" is activated and "Remove Brainwashing" is chained (or was already active on the field), the monster goes to the side of the field of the player who activated "Monster Reborn", then switches back to the original owner immediately afterwards.
*   If "Remove Brainwashing" is activated and a player already has 5 monsters on the field, the returning monsters are destroyed. If multiple monsters are returning to the owner due to "Remove Brainwashing", and he does not have enough room for all of them, the player who controlled the monsters chooses the ones that are destroyed and the ones that return successfully.
*   When "Snatch Steal" is active, the +1000 Life Points effect is applied even if "Remove Brainwashing" has returned control of the monster to the original owner.
*   "Remove Brainwashing" has no effect on a Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict", and the Monster Card remains where it is, because it is an Equip Spell Card.
*   If "Remove Brainwashing" is destroyed, control does not revert again, so if I activate "Change of Heart" and my opponent chains "Remove Brainwashing", control of the monster comes to me and then reverts to my opponent. Then, later in the turn, if "Remove Brainwashing" is destroyed with "Heavy Storm", control does not revert back to me and remains with the original owner. (The same for "Creature Swap", etc.)
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with "Snatch Steal", etc., and you activate "Relinquished"'s effect on your next turn to equip the monster to "Relinquished", and your opponent chains "Remove Brainwashing" to "Relinquished"'s effect, control of the monster returns to you before "Relinquished"'s effect resolves and, since you cannot use "Relinquished"'s effect on monsters on your side of the field, "Relinquished"'s effect disappears.
*   Control of "Blindly Loyal Goblin" cannot change even because of "Remove Brainwashing", so if "Blindly Loyal Goblin" is Summoned due to "Monster Reborn" or using "Exchange", the original owner will not control "Blindly Loyal Goblin".

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Player 1 has all 5 Monster Zones filled and Player 2 activates “Monster Reborn” on a Monster in Player 1s Graveyard. What happens to the selected Monster if “Remove Brainwashing” is either already active or activated after “Monster Reborn” is resolved? Since the Monster can't fit back on its owners Field would it be destroyed, would nothing happen until there is an open slot or something completely different?  
    A: The monster would be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 12/04/2003

#### RESCUE CAT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If one of the monsters Special Summoned by “Rescue Cat”’s effect is flipped face-down, or removed from play temporarily, the effect of “Rescue Cat” is reset and that monster is not destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If your opponent controls your “Rescue Cat” and activates its effect, your opponent gets the effect and Special Summons Beast-Type monsters from his/her Deck.
*   You can activate the effect of “Rescue Cat” even if there is only 1 or zero Level 3 or lower Beast-Type monsters in your Deck. However, in this case you cannot Special Summon any Beast-Type monsters for the effect of “Rescue Cat”, and your opponent gets to check your Deck to confirm.

#### RESHEF THE DARK BEING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Reshef the Dark Being” is an Ignition Effect. Discarding is a cost for activation of this effect.
*   If the monster that you take control of with “Reshef the Dark Being” is flipped face-down, it still returns to the opponent during the End Phase.

#### RETURN FROM THE DIFFERENT DIMENSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If a monster Special Summoned by this card is flipped face-down, then it will not be removed from play during the End Phase.

#### RETURN OF THE DOOMED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card is activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2 and creates a state that lasts until the end of your turn. If "Spell Canceller" is Summoned after this card was activated, but during the same turn, the state it created is not negated and 1 monster will return to your hand if destroyed during this turn.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is on the field, a monster that is destroyed will be removed from play and cannot return to your hand since it never went to the Graveyard.

#### REVERSAL QUIZ

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Sending all cards in the hand and on the field to the Graveyard is a cost. If there are no cards in your hand or on the field you cannot activate this card. You must have a card either in your hand or on the field to activate this card.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If I activate “Reversal Quiz” with a “Black Pendant” on the field, does the damage from “Black Pendant” occur before or after our Life Points are exchanged?  
    A: After. Curtis Schultz, 04/04/2004

#### REVERSE TRAP

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If a card gives a monster +100 ATK, and "Reverse Trap" is activated, that monster now has -100 ATK instead. This card only affects increases and decreases of a defined value, such as +200 (which becomes -200) or -500 (which becomes +500). It does not change cards which "double", "half", or "reduce to 0" the ATK or DEF of a monster.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step. This card affects monsters, Spell Cards, and Trap Cards controlled by both players.
*   Additional "Reverse Traps" activated in the same turn will have no effect. So "Reverse Trap" will change "Axe of Despair’"s effect of adding 1000 ATK to subtracting 1000 ATK. If a second "Reverse Trap" is activated, the equipped monster still has -1000 ATK.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If an effect sets ATK or DEF to a specific value, “Reverse Trap” will have no effect on this.

#### REVIVAL JAM

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Change of Heart" to take control of "Revival Jam", and it is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, the owner (not you) gets the option to pay 1000 Life Points to Special Summon "Revival Jam" to their side of the field.
*   The cost of 1000 Life Points is paid when "Revival Jam" is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle. If "Revival Jam" is removed from the Graveyard before your next Standby Phase by cards like "Disappear" you do not get your Life Points returned to you.
*   If you pay 1000 Life Points when your "Revival Jam" is sent to the Graveyard, and then activate "Call of the Haunted" to return it to the field before your next Standby Phase, and it is again destroyed you must pay another 1000 Life Points if you want it to return during your next Standby Phase. Its condition was reset when it was taken out of the Graveyard by the effect of "Call of the Haunted".

#### RING OF DESTRUCTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Ring of Destruction" during the Damage Step.
*   "Ring of Destruction" inflicts damage based on the current (total) ATK value, NOT the original ATK.
*   This card targets a monster.
*   If you chain "Ring of Destruction" to "Magic Cylinder", "Magic Cylinder"’s effect disappears because the monster is no longer there (so "Magic Cylinder" inflicts no damage).
*   If a player Tributes "Witch of the Black Forest" for "Summoned Skull", you can chain "Ring of Destruction" to the effect of "Witch of the Black Forest", in order to destroy "Summoned Skull". If this reduces the player’s Life Points to zero, then they cannot use "Witch of the Black Forest"’s effect (to retrieve a 5th Exodia piece, for example).

#### RING OF MAGNETISM

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If there is a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" on the opponent’s side of the field, if your monsters are going to attack they must attack the equipped monster. Even Toon Monsters, "Inaba White Rabbit", and monsters like "Jinzo #7" and "Queen’s Double" that can normally Attack Directly must attack the equipped monster.
*   If you have two or more monsters on your side of the field equipped with your "Ring of Magnetism" cards, you choose which monster will be attacked.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” changes control, the opponent of the current controller of the monster will have to attack the monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism.”

#### RIRYOKU

Netrep Rulings:

*   "Riryoku” has two targeting aspects.
*   “Riryoku” will resolve without effect if either of its targets is “Gradius’s Option.”

#### RIRYOKU FIELD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card cannot be used against "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" since they do not target a monster on the field.
*   This card cannot be used against "Fissure", "Smashing Ground", or "Dark Hole" because these cards do not target.

#### RISING ENERGY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate “Rising Energy” during the damage step.
*   Discarding 1 card is a cost to activate “Rising Energy”.

#### RIVALRY OF WARLORDS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Rivalry of Warlords" is activated, each player must send monsters to the Graveyard so that he controls only 1 Type of monster face-up. You don't select or name a Type when "Rivalry of Warlords" is activated; instead, you make it so you have only 1 Type. If, after this, your monsters are destroyed so you have no monsters on the field, you are free to play any Type again, and that new Type becomes the Type that you must play. (So if you send monsters to the Graveyard so you control only Spellcaster-Types, and your Spellcaster-Type monsters are destroyed, you may play a Dragon-Type monster, but can then only play Dragon-Type monsters as long as you control 1 or more face-up Dragon-Type monsters. If all your monsters are again destroyed, you can again play whatever Type you want.)
*   This also means that when "Rivalry of Warlords" is active, each player can control a different face-up Type than his opponent.
*   You can activate "Rivalry of Warlords" when either or both player(s) does not have any face-up monsters on the field, in which case once a player does have a face-up monster that monster's Type becomes that player's Type for purposes of "Rivalry of Warlords" (as long as the monster remains face-up on that player's side of the field).
*   When "Rivalry of Warlords" is activated, it has no effect on monsters that are face-down at that time and does not flip those monsters face-up.
*   While "Rivalry of Warlords" is active, you can still Set monsters face-down if they are a different Type than the Type you control. If your face-down monster of a different Type is attacked, then the monster is destroyed after damage calculation. If the destroyed monster of a different Type was a Flip Effect Monster, its Flip Effect is still activated, and then the destroyed monster is sent to the Graveyard. If your face-down monster of a different Type is flipped by "Swords of Revealing Light", "Book of Taiyou", etc., then it is destroyed as necessary.
*   As long as "Rivalry of Warlords" is active, you cannot Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon an inappropriate Type face-up (including "Jinzo"), but you can Special Summon face-down with "The Shallow Grave", "Morphing Jar #2", etc.
*   If you have only 1 monster on the field face-up, you may Tribute it for a monster that is a different Type.
*   If you have 2 monsters on the field face-up of the same Type, you cannot Tribute 1 of them for another monster that is a different Type (even "Jinzo") as you would then have 2 different Types.
*   If "Cyber Jar" is activated while "Rivalry of Warlords" is active, you can Special Summon different Types of monsters face-down without penalty, or Special Summon 1 Type face-up and all the others face-down. But if you Special Summon different Types of monsters face-up, you have to destroy monsters to make it 1 Type.
*   When "Rivalry of Warlords" is active, and you change the Type of all of your monsters with "DNA Surgery" or "Parasite Paracide" or "D. Tribe", you now only have 1 Type so you are OK and no monsters are destroyed, and you can also Summon, Flip Summon, and Special Summon additional monsters that do not have that printed Type on the card and they will be considered that Type and are not destroyed.
*   If you activate "Magical Hats" while "Rivalry of Warlords" is active, the cards Special Summoned with "Magical Hats" are unaffected by "Rivalry of Warlords" because they have no Type.
*   When "Rivalry of Warlords" is active you can activate "Dragonic Attack", but if you have other face-up monsters that are not Dragon-Types then the targeted monster is destroyed.
*   If "Rivalry of Warlords" is active and you take control of your opponent's face-up monster with "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal", and that monster is a different Type than your other face-up monster(s), your opponent's monster is destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a face-down monster is turned face up and does not match the Type of the other monsters on the field while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, that monster is destroyed after Damage Calculation.
*   If “Rivalry of Warlords” is activated in a chain with an effect that would Special Summon a monster of a differing Type, the Special Summoning effect disappears.
*   Monsters may be Set or Special Summoned face-down, even if of a different Type while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active.
*   If Machine is not the current type and a Tribute summon would not remove all monsters from that side of the field, “Jinzo” may not be summoned while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active.

#### ROBBIN' GOBLIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have "Robbin’ Goblin" on the field and attack with "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" or "The Bistro Butcher" both effects activate simultaneously. Since you control both effects you can choose the order that they go on a Chain, so you can have the opponent draw due to the effect of "The Bistro Butcher" and then discard for the effect of "Robbin’ Goblin".

#### ROC FROM THE VALLEY OF HAZE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Because this effect is a mandatory Trigger Effect, you cannot "miss the timing" with it. So even if you send "Roc from the Valley of Haze" to the Graveyard as a cost, or in the middle of a chain, it will still return to your hand (after resolving the current series of events).

#### ROCKET JUMPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your opponent has only Defense Position monsters on the field, you can attack directly with "Rocket Jumper", but if your opponent has a Spell or Trap Card, you cannot attack directly with "Rocket Jumper".

#### ROD OF SILENCE - KAY'EST

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you equip "Rod of Silence - Kay'est" to a monster equipped with other Equip Spell Cards, those cards are destroyed.

#### ROD OF THE MIND'S EYE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The damage caused by "Rod of the Mind's Eye" is Battle Damage, so it can be reduced to zero with "Waboku" or "Kuriboh".
*   When you equip "Rod of the Mind's Eye" to "Susa Soldier" or "Shadowknight Archfiend", the Battle Damage is 1000 points.
*   When "Gravekeeper's Vassal" is equipped with "Rod of the Mind's Eye", the effect is not activated because the damage caused by "Gravekeeper's Vassal" is effect damage.

#### ROPE OF LIFE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Discarding your hand is a cost and the cost must be at least 1 card. So if you have zero cards in your hand, you cannot activate "Rope of Life".
*   If your monster is controlled by your opponent and sent to your Graveyard, you can activate "Rope of Life". You cannot activate "Rope of Life" when your opponent’s monster you control is sent to his/her Graveyard.
*   The increase in ATK is permanent as long as the monster remains face-up on the field.
*   You can use "Rope of Life" to Special Summon "Jinzo" and "Jinzo"'s ATK will increase by 800 points.

#### ROULETTE BARREL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only use "Roulette Barrel"'s effect once per turn.
*   You have to roll a die twice, not once. You must roll the die twice in a row, not once in Main Phase 1 and once in Main Phase 2, etc.
*   You CAN select a die roll result which doesn't match the Level Stars of a face-up monster. But if the die roll you select does match a monster, you MUST destroy a face-up monster with the correct number of Level Stars.
*   "Roulette Barrel" can destroy itself with its effect.
*   You cannot destroy a monster with 7 or more stars with "Roulette Barrel"'s effect.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Dice Re-Roll’s” effect is used for the purpose of re-rolling for “Roulette Barrel,” both dice are re-rolled.

#### ROYAL COMMAND

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card can be chained to the activation of a Flip Effect from a Flip Summon to negate the Flip Effect. It cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so if a Flip Effect Monster is flipped face-up when attacked you cannot chain "Royal Command" to negate its Flip Effect.
*   If "Royal Command" is active on the field both players may still Flip Summon monsters, but any Flip Effects are negated.

#### ROYAL DECREE

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Skill Drain” is active on the field when “Jinzo” is summoned, and “Royal Decree” is later activated, “Royal Decree” will negate “Skill Drain”. Since “Skill Drain” is no longer negating “Jinzo’s” effect, “Jinzo” will negate both “Royal Decree” and “Skill Drain.”

#### ROYAL KEEPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of "Royal Keeper" is not a Flip Effect.
*   When a face-down "Royal Keeper" is attacked and flipped face-up, its +300 ATK effect is applied AFTER damage calculation.
*   When your opponent activates "Bottomless Trap Hole" against "Royal Keeper", the +300 ATK effect of "Royal Keeper" resolves after "Bottomless Trap Hole".

#### ROYAL OPPRESSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   There are basically 2 ways to Special Summon a monster. The first way is with a Spell Card like "Monster Reborn", a Trap Card like "Call of the Haunted", or an Effect Monster like "Magical Scientist". The second way is built in to the monster, and Special Summons it without activating an effect, such as "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" or "Dark Necrofear". "Royal Oppression" can negate both of these types of Special Summon. In the first case, you chain the activation of "Royal Oppression"’s effect to the activation of the Spell, Trap, or Monster Card’s effect, and negate the effect. In the second case, right before the monster is Special Summoned, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon (the same procedure that you use for "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment").

*   Example 1: If "Marauding Captain" is Normal Summoned, its effect activates. You can chain to this effect by activating the effect of "Royal Oppression". The effect of "Marauding Captain" is negated, no monster is Special Summoned, and the "Marauding Captain" is destroyed. (The monster your opponent intended to Special Summon with the effect of "Marauding Captain" remains in his hand.)
*   Example 2: If "Cyber Jar" is Flip Summoned and its Flip Effect activates, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in a chain to the Flip Effect. The effect of "Cyber Jar" is negated, no monsters on the field are destroyed by its effect, no cards are picked up, no monsters are Special Summoned, and "Cyber Jar" is destroyed by the effect of "Royal Oppression".
*   Example 3: If "Call of the Haunted" is activated, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in a chain. The effect of "Call of the Haunted" is negated, and a monster is not Special Summoned.

*   The effects of face-up Trap Cards cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so this card’s effect cannot negate the Special Summoning of a monster by the effect of “Mystic Tomato” or a “Cyber Jar” flipped face-up by an attack.
*   You can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" as a chain to "Monster Gate". No cards will be picked up, and no monster will be Special Summoned (The opponent still must have Tributed a monster as a cost).
*   You can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate an effect that Summons 1 monster, or Summons multiple monsters (like "Cyber Jar", "The Shallow Grave", or "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior").
*   If "Royal Oppression" is face-up on the field, and "Monster Reborn" is activated to Special Summon "Jinzo", you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in a chain to negate the Special Summon because "Jinzo" is not on the field until the chain resolves.
*   If you have "Royal Oppression" face-up on your side of the field, and your opponent attempts to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear", and you activate the effect of your "Royal Oppression", then "Dark Necrofear" will activate its effect in the Graveyard and return to the field as an Equip Spell Card. But if your opponent had "Royal Oppression" face-up on his side of the field, and you activate the effect of your opponent’s "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon of your opponent’s "Dark Necrofear", then "Dark Necrofear" does not activate its effect in the Graveyard, because it was destroyed by an effect controlled by its owner, not by its owner’s opponent (even though the owner did not activate the effect, he still controls the "Royal Oppression" card).
*   When "Vampire Lord" is Special Summoned by its effect, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon and destroy "Vampire Lord". If your "Vampire Lord" is destroyed in this way by the effect of a "Royal Oppression" card controlled by your opponent, then "Vampire Lord" was destroyed by a card controlled by your opponent, and is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.
*   When "Insect Queen" destroys your opponent’s monster, an "Insect Monster Token" is Special Summoned during the End Phase, and the effect of "Royal Oppression" can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy "Insect Queen".
*   When "Jam Breeding Machine" activates its effect to Special Summon a "Slime Token" in the Standby Phase, and the effect of "Royal Oppression" can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy "Jam Breeding Machine".
*   If the effect of "Royal Oppression" is activated, and "Mystical Space Typhoon" or "Dust Tornado" is chained to destroy "Royal Oppression", then the effect of "Royal Oppression" disappears because it is a Continuous Trap Card, and the Special Summon will not be negated.
*   Remember that "Royal Oppression" follows the rules of all Continuous Trap Cards. In order to chain the effect of "Royal Oppression" to a card effect, "Royal Oppression" must have already been face-up on the field. For example, if "Monster Reborn" is activated, you cannot flip "Royal Oppression" face-up and activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in the same chain.

#### ROYAL TRIBUTE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Both players must show their hands to the opponent when "Royal Tribute" resolves.
*   If you activate "Royal Tribute" and your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Necrovalley", the effect of "Royal Tribute" still resolves.

#### RYU-KISHIN CLOWN

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Final Attack Orders” is active when “Ryu-Kishin Clown’s” effect triggers, the targeted monster will switch to Defense Position and then immediately change to Attack Position.

#### RYU KOKKI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Ryu Kokki" battles with "Dark Magician of Chaos", "Ryu Kokki" is destroyed and removed from play by "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect, and "Dark Magician of Chaos" is removed from play because it is destroyed by "Ryu Kokki"'s effect and removed by its own effect.

#### RYU SENSHI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card’s effect that negates Spell Cards that target it is not optional.
*   You can Special Summon this card from the Graveyard with "Monster Reborn" because its effect that negates Spell Cards is not active while it is in the Graveyard (but only if was properly Fusion Summoned originally).
*   A Spell Card that targets this card may be activated, but it will be negated and destroyed.
*   The effect of this card will not negate "Creature Swap", "Fissure", "Smashing Ground", "Dark Hole", "Raigeki", or similar cards that do not target.
*   If you try to equip "Fusion Sword Murasame Blade" to this monster, it will be negated and destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Ryu Senshi” may only negate the effect of a Normal Trap Card.
*   “Ryu Senshi” cannot negate the effect of a Continuous Trap Card or a Counter Trap Card.

#### SACRED CRANE

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of "Sacred Crane" does not activate if it is Special Summoned face-down.

#### SACRED PHOENIX OF NEPHTHYS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its own effect. Because this effect activates in the Graveyard, and is being negated while "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is in the Graveyard, "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is never Special Summoned (so the card is never moved from the Graveyard) and is never destroyed. Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned with “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”, and that card is destroyed and destroys “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” with its effect, you Special Summon “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while in your hand or Deck by a card effect, you still activate its effect during your next Standby Phase to Special Summon it from the Graveyard. (For example, if an effect like “Star Boy” is active, and “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” is activated to destroy other copies of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” in the hand and Deck, those copies will be Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.
*   If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that Special Summons it from the Graveyard is still activated, because it is activated in the Graveyard. However, the effect that destroys Spell and Trap Cards on the field is negated because it activates on the field (so “Skill Drain” and other Spell and Trap Cards on the field are not destroyed in this case).
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and the Summon is negated by “Horn of Heaven”, it is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.
*   If your opponent controls your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys”, and it is destroyed by a card effect, because the effect activates in the Graveyard, it is the owner that gets the effect and Special Summons “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during their Standby Phase.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed during your Draw Phase, you can Special Summon it during the Standby Phase of that same turn.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed and removed from play, such as with “Bottomless Trap Hole”, it is not Special Summoned from out of play during the Standby Phase, because this effect activates in the Graveyard.
*   If “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, and your opponent takes control of your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” while controlling monsters that are not Winged Beast-Type, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is not considered destroyed by the effect of “Rivalry of Warlords”, but rather by a condition that made it impossible for it to exist on that side of the field. So it is not Special Summoned by its own effect during the Standby Phase.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while it is not a Monster Card, such as when it is equipped to “Relinquished” or “Sword Hunter”, its effect does not activate and it is not Special Summoned.
*   You can chain to the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that destroys all Spell and Trap Cards.
*   If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its effect during the Standby Phase, and “Card of Safe Return” is on the field, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Step 1 of the chain and “Card of Safe Return” is Step 2, so “Card of Safe Return” resolves first and you draw a card before “Card of Safe Return” is destroyed.

#### SAKURETSU ARMOR

Individual Card Rulings:

*   "Sakuretsu Armor" targets 1 monster.
*   If the turn player chains "Book of Moon" to "Sakuretsu Armor" to flip the attacking monster face-down, then the attacking monster is not destroyed by "Sakuretsu Armor".

#### SALVAGE

Individual Card Rulings:

*   "Salvage" targets 2 WATER monsters in the Graveyard.
*   If 1 of the targeted WATER monsters is removed from the Graveyard by an effect chained to "Salvage", the remaining WATER monster is still added to your hand.

#### SANGA OF THE THUNDER

Individual Card Rulings:

*   A marker may be placed on this card to indicate that its effect has been used. The effect resets if the monster is destroyed or removed from the field.
*   You can use the effect of this card even if it is face-down when it is attacked because its effect is activated during the Damage Step, and it will be face-up at that point.
*   The effect of this card targets.

#### SANGAN

Individual Card Rulings:

*   You must show your opponent the monster you select from your Deck for this card’s effect. If you have no eligible monsters, your opponent gets to see your Deck to verify.
*   The effect of "Sangan" only activates when it is sent from the field to the Graveyard, not from your hand or Deck, and not if it is removed from play.
*   If the Summon of this card is negated with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment" you do not get its effect.
*   If you control your opponent’s "Sangan" and it is destroyed, your opponent gets the effect since it activates in his/her Graveyard.
*   You can chain to "Sangan"’s effect.

#### SASUKE SAMURAI

Individual Card Rulings:

*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, apply its effect after entering the Damage Step, but before flipping up the face-down monster. The monster is not flipped. Flip Effects are not activated. Monsters like "Kisetai" and "Giant Axe Mummy" do not activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, there is no damage calculation. "Sasuke Samurai" destroys the monster before damage calculation is reached.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" destroys a face-down monster using its effect, the face-down monster is NOT "destroyed as a result of battle", it is destroyed by "Sasuke Samurai"’s effect. So "Mystic Tomato", "Helpoemer", etc. will not activate their effects. However, monsters like "Sangan" will still activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, and "Ceasefire" is activated during the Battle Step to flip it face-up, "Sasuke Samurai" does not destroy it with its effect and damage calculation is applied normally. The monster must be face-down at the beginning of the Damage Step in order for "Sasuke Samurai" to activate its effect.

#### SASUKE SAMURAI #2

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only activate "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect during your Main Phase 1 or 2 because it's an Ignition Effect.
*   You can only activate "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect once per turn.
*   The effect of "Sasuke Samurai #2" stops in the End Phase, and after the effect ends, you can activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards during the remainder of the End Phase.
*   While "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect is active, you can't activate the effects of cards that activate in the Graveyard like "Black Pendant" and "Statue of the Wicked".
*   You cannot activate the effects of Continuous cards like "Skull Lair", "Ultimate Offering", or "Mass Driver" while "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect is active.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Spell and Trap effects may be activated in a chain to “Sasuke Samurai #2’s” effect.

#### SASUKE SAMURAI #4

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You activate the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. A monster destroyed by the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" is not destroyed as a result of battle. There is no damage calculation. It is not flipped face-up. Any Flip Effects it has are not activated.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai #4" attacks a face-up Attack Position "Reflect Bounder", the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" is resolved before the effect of "Reflect Bounder".

#### SCAPEGOAT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can only activate "Scapegoat" if you have 4 or more vacant Monster Card Zones.
*   If the effect of "Cyber Jar" is activated during the turn you already activated "Scapegoat" all monsters that could be Special Summoned will be sent to the Graveyard.
*   If your opponent chains "Magic Jammer" to your "Scapegoat" you may still perform Summons that turn, but if they chain "Imperial Order" you may not perform Summons.
*   You may offer Sheep Tokens as Tributes for Toon Monsters, since they are Special Summoned and not Tribute Summoned.
*   If the effect of "Royal Oppression" is chained to your "Scapegoat" your Sheep Tokens will not be Special Summoned and you still cannot perform any Summons that turn.
*   If you have already Summoned a monster, including a Special Summon caused by the effect of your opponent’s "Cyber Jar" you cannot activate "Scapegoat".
*   You can Set a monster in the same turn you activate "Scapegoat".
*   If you control 2 monsters and your opponent activates "Change of Heart" to gain control of one and you later activate "Scapegoat" your monster will be destroyed during the End Phase if all 5 of your Monster Card Zones are still occupied.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" and your opponent chains "Imperial Order" you can chain "Scapegoat" and "Royal Decree" but only "Scapegoat" will resolve since "Scapegoat" will prevent any Special Summons, and therefore "Monster Reborn" cannot resolve.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters may not be Summoned by the player before or after “Scapegoat’s” resolution.
*   If the activation of “Scapegoat” is negated, the player may Summon a monster.
*   Monsters may be Set before or after the resolution of “Scapegoat.”
*   If a monster would be forced to be summoned after the resolution of “Scapegoat,” that monster will be sent to the Graveyard instead.
*   Sheep Tokens may be Tributed for any purpose other than a Tribute Summon per the text of “Scapegoat.”

#### SCROLL OF BEWITCHMENT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you switch the target of this card with "Collected Power" or "Tailor of the Fickle" you do not select a new Attribute. The newly equipped monster becomes the Attribute that was originally selected when "Scroll of Bewitchment" was activated, even if it is the same as the monster’s original Attribute.

#### SECOND COIN TOSS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this card only applies when you perform a coin toss, not when your opponent performs a coin toss.
*   If an effect requires multiple coin flips, like "Barrel Dragon", you would redo all 3 coin flips.
*   Even if multiple "Second Coin Toss" cards are active, you can only redo each coin toss once.
*   Even if the original coin toss came out in your favor, you may use the effect of "Second Coin Toss" and redo the toss.

#### SECOND GOBLIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of changing a monster's Battle Position can only be used once per turn.

Netrep Rulings:

*   A “Giant Orc” equipped with “Second Goblin” may be changed to attack position after being changed to defense position through its effect, as long as “Second Goblin’s” effect has not been used.

#### SECRET BARREL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Secret Barrel" and your opponent activates something as a chain, the chained card is included in the number (so if your opponent's only card on the field or in his hand is "Mystical Space Typhoon", and he chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "Secret Barrel", he still takes 200 damage).
*   Monster Tokens are counted for "Secret Barrel".

#### SECRET PASS TO THE TREASURES

Individual Card FAQs:

*   There is no way to have a monster with an ATK above 1000 attack directly using the effect of "Secret Pass to the Treasures". When you target a monster with "Secret Pass to the Treasures", and the monster’s ATK is increased above 1000 afterwards, the monster cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly.
*   If the monster attacks your opponent’s Life Points directly, you cannot use an effect such as "Rush Recklessly" to increase its ATK above 1000 during the attack. If a monster attacks directly using the effect of "Secret Pass to the Treasures", "automatic" increases will not apply ("Super Robolady", etc.). If you use "Secret Pass to the Treasures" on "Injection Fairy Lily", and attack directly, you cannot activate the effect of "Injection Fairy Lily".
*   You cannot activate "Secret Pass to the Treasures" during Main Phase 2 or on the very first turn.
*   This card targets a monster.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters able to attack more than once in a turn may attack directly each time from the effect of “Secret Pass to the Treasures” as long as the ATK of the monster does not rise above 1000.

#### SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Self-Destruction Button", and an effect is chained so that the different in Life Points is less than 7000, "Self-Destruction Button" still resolves because its conditions were correct at the time of activation.

#### SENRI EYE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot use "Senri Eye"'s effect more than once during the same Standby Phase.
*   You can use the effect of "Senri Eye" if the top card on the Deck is face-up (due to "Convulsion of Nature" or "Parasite Paracide"), and in that case you don't hide the card from your opponent.

#### SERIAL SPELL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Serial Spell" must be chained to the activation of your Normal Spell Card. Nothing can be chained in-between by yourself or your opponent. If your opponent chains to your Normal Spell Card, you cannot chain "Serial Spell" to that Normal Spell Card. Because of this, it is impossible to chain 2 copies of "Serial Spell" to the same Normal Spell Card.
*   "Serial Spell" does not target a card.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to a Normal Spell Card that targets a card(s) you can select a different target(s) for the "Serial Spell" copy of the Normal Spell Card.
*   Discarding your hand is a cost to activate "Serial Spell". You cannot activate "Serial Spell" if it is the only card in your hand, or if it is Set and you have no cards in your hand.
*   "Serial Spell" only copies the effects of your Normal Spell Card, not any costs of that Spell Card. So if you chain "Serial Spell" to "Delinquent Duo" you do not pay an additional 1000 Life Points.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn", and chain "Serial Spell", discarding your entire hand, you can select and revive one of the monsters you discarded for the cost of "Serial Spell" to be the monster that "Serial Spell" Special Summons to the field. (For example, if you target "Dark Magician" with "Monster Reborn", then chain "Serial Spell" and discard "Buster Blader", you can use "Serial Spell" to Special Summon the "Buster Blader" you discarded to activate "Serial Spell".)
*   You cannot level up "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" from 4 to 8 with just "Level Up!" and "Serial Spell". Because you would send "LV4" to the Graveyard for "Level Up!", but even if you copy it with "Serial Spell", the first "Level Up!" hasn't resolved, so "LV6" isn't on the field to send to the Graveyard as a cost for the copy of "Level Up!" If you have "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" and "Armed Dragon LV3" on the field, and send one of them to the Graveyard with "Level Up!", you cannot use "Serial Spell" to Level Up the other monster, since there was no monster sent to the Graveyard as a cost for "Serial Spell", and "Serial Spell" would have no point of reference to resolve its effect.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Swords of Revealing Light" it will copy the effect of flipping all monsters face-up, but it will not remain on the field and prevent the opponent from attacking. This is because it is a Quick-Play Spell Card and is sent to the Graveyard after the chain resolves.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Different Dimension Capsule" it will copy the effect and remove 1 card you select in your Deck from play, face-down. But because "Serial Spell" does not remain on the field, the selected card remains removed from play face-down and is not placed in your hand.
*   You can activate "Serial Spell" to copy the effect of a Normal Spell Card, even if it is "Raigeki" or "Soul Exchange" and copying the effect serves no real purpose.
*   If you have 2 monsters in your Graveyard, and your opponent only has 1 monster in their Graveyard, you can activate "The Shallow Grave" and chain "Serial Spell", even though you would not normally be able to activate a second "The Shallow Grave" because your monster would no longer have any monsters in the Graveyard. As a result, you will Special Summon 2 monsters and your opponent will only Special Summon 1 monster.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Bait Doll", the entire effect of "Bait Doll" is applied and "Serial Spell" is also shuffled back into your Deck.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Dragged Down into the Grave", the player who activated "Serial Spell" has no cards in hand, so the effect of "Dragged Down into the Grave" is impossible to resolve, and the effect disappears.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Metamorphosis", there is no effect because you did not Tribute a monster for a cost, so "Serial Spell" has no point of reference and cannot resolve.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Monster Gate" resolve the effect of "Monster Gate" twice (once for "Serial Spell" and once for "Monster Gate") even though you only pay the cost once (for "Monster Gate").

#### SERPENTINE PRINCESS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "Serpentine Princess" is returned to the Deck by an effect occurring in a chain, the effect of "Serpentine Princess" starts a new Chain after the current Chain resolves completely.
*   If the effect of "Fiber Jar" places "Serpentine Princess" from the field into your Deck, the effect of "Serpentine Princess" is activated and will be applied after the effect of "Fiber Jar" has finished resolving.

#### SEVEN TOOLS OF THE BANDIT

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Seven Tools of the Bandit” may not be activated in a chain to the use of an effect of a continuous Trap that has already been activated, like “Ultimate Offering.”

#### SHADOWSLAYER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   For "Shadowslayer" (unlike cards like "Black Tyranno" and "Drillago"), only the Monster Card Zones are looked at. If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position, then "Shadowslayer" can attack directly even if your opponent has Spell and Trap Cards on the field.
*   If "Shadowslayer" attacks a face-up Attack Position monster, and the opponent activates "Book of Moon" so that his only monster on the field is now in Defense Position, a replay occurs, because "Shadowslayer" is now able to attack directly.
*   If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position but one of them is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", "Shadowslayer" cannot attack directly and must attack that monster if it attacks.

#### SHADOW SPELL

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Shadow Spell” is negated or leaves the field, the targeted monster is not affected by the effect of “Shadow Spell.”

#### SHIELD & SWORD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card only switches the original ATK and DEF. All modifiers are then applied (or re-applied, as appropriate) to the new ATK and DEF.

#### SHIEN'S SPY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you use “Shien’s Spy” on “Silent Swordsman LV5”, it returns to your control during the End Phase as normal.
*   If you chain “Book of Moon” to “Shien’s Spy” to flip the target face-down, the monster still switches to the opponent and returns in the End Phase as normal.
*   If a monster switches sides because of “Shien’s Spy” and is then flipped face-down, it still returns in the End Phase as normal.
*   When a monster returns to the controller during the End Phase for the effect of “Shien’s Spy”, this is not an effect that can be chained to.

#### SHIFTING SHADOWS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have only 1 face-down Defense Position monster you cannot activate the effect of "Shifting Shadows".
*   If you control a monster that is targeted by your opponent's "Nightmare Wheel", and you flip it face-down with "Book of Moon", and control at least 1 other face-down Defense Position monster, you can activate the effect of “Shifting Shadows”. However, afterwards you must tell your opponent which monster is targeted by “Nightmare Wheel”.

#### SHINATO, KING OF A HIGHER PLANE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys "Gradius' Option" or "Maju Garzett", your opponent takes no damage from "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   If "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is destroyed before monsters are sent to the Graveyard, for example if removed from play by "D. D. Warrior Lady", his effect does not activate. But if "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" attacks "Yomi Ship", "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts the damage from his effect even though he will be destroyed by "Yomi Ship"'s effect after "Yomi Ship" is sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys a Defense Position monster, your opponent can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" as a chain to "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush" and destroys your opponent's Defense Position monster, first, during damage calculation, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent's Life Points because of "Fairy Meteor Crush", and then, when the Defense Position monster is sent to the Graveyard, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect inflicts damage equal to the original ATK of the destroyed monster.

#### SHINING ANGEL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you attack with your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Shining Angel" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Shining Angel" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

#### SHOOTING STAR BOW - CEAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" decreases the current ATK. So if "Injection Fairy Lily" is equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and activates her effect, her ATK is 2400 ((400 - 1000) + 3000 = 2400).
*   If a monster equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" declares a direct attack, and "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" is removed from the monster during the Battle Step with "Mystical Space Typhoon" or "Tailor of the Fickle", the monster is no longer capable of attacking directly and a replay occurs.
*   "Tyrant Dragon" must attack a monster in order to gain its second attack, so if it is equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and attacks directly, it cannot get a second attack. But "Tyrant Dragon" equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" can attack a monster, and then attack directly.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Would equipping “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” on a fusion summoned with Magical Scientist allow it to attack directly? A: A monster that is Special Summoned via “Magical Scientist's” effect... cannot attack the opponent directly. Even equipping the Fusion monster with “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” won't change that condition. Steve Okegawa, 12/18/2003

#### SILENT SWORDSMAN LV3

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Silent Swordsman LV3" will negate the effects of your opponent’s Spell Cards that target it, whether that Spell Card targets just "Silent Swordsman LV3" (such as "Soul Exchange") or multiple monsters ("Different Dimension Gate").

#### SILENT SWORDSMAN LV5

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Just like “The Legendary Fisherman” and other monsters that are unaffected by Spell Cards, “Silent Swordsman LV5” can attack normally if your opponent has “Swords of Revealing Light” on the field, and its controller is unaffected by effects like “Toll” and “Gravekeeper’s Servant” when “Silent Swordsman LV5” attacks.
*   If you control “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” and “Silent Swordsman LV5”, and your opponent activates “Fissure”, the monster with the lowest ATK is “Silent Swordsman LV5”, but it is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of “Fissure” disappears.
*   “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected by Spell Cards your opponent controls, including those in your opponent’s hand due to “Exchange” or “Graverobber”.
*   You can Special Summon “Silent Swordsman LV5” with “Autonomous Action Unit”. If “Autonomous Action Unit” is removed from the field, “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected and remains on the field.

#### SINISTER SERPENT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this card is optional; you do not have to return it to your hand.
*   The effect of this card activates no matter how it is sent to the Graveyard. It can be destroyed, Tributed, discarded from the hand, or sent straight from the Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If your "Sinister Serpent" is on the field and is destroyed during your Standby Phase, you may return it to your hand during that same Standby Phase.
*   If "Sinister Serpent" is destroyed as a result of battle with "Dark Ruler Ha Des" or "Dark Balter the Terrible" you cannot activate its effect and return it to your hand during your next Standby Phase, or any subsequent Standby Phase.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "Sinister Serpent" if "The End of Anubis" is on the field.
*   "Necrovalley" does not negate the effect of "Sinister Serpent".

#### SKILL DRAIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.
*   "Skill Drain" negates the effects of face-up Effect Monsters on the field, but does not negate effects that activate in the Graveyard, such as "Witch of the Black Forest", "Sangan", "Mystic Tomato", "Giant Rat", "Exiled Force", "Sinister Serpent", and "Vampire Lord".
*   If your "Dark Flare Knight" is sent to the Graveyard while "Skill Drain" is active, its effect activates in the Graveyard so you can Special Summon "Mirage Knight" (but "Mirage Knight"'s effects will be negated once it is in play).
*   If your "Neko Mane King" is sent to the Graveyard by your opponent's card effect while "Skill Drain" is active, its effect is activated.
*   If your "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while "Skill Drain" is active, its effect activates and it is Special Summoned.
*   “Skill Drain” will not negate an Ignition Effect or Trigger Effect if the Effect Monster is not face-up on the field when the effect resolves.
*   "Skill Drain" does not stop you from activating Ignition Effects, but it does negate their effects as long as the Effect Monster remains on the field. If you Tribute "Cannon Soldier" to itself while "Skill Drain" is active, "Cannon Soldier"'s effect is not negated because "Cannon Soldier" is in the Graveyard, but if you Tribute a different monster for "Cannon Soldier"'s effect, then the effect is negated and your opponent takes no damage. Likewise, if you activate "Winged Minion"'s effect while "Skill Drain" is active, "Winged Minion" is no longer on the field and its effect resolves. If you activate "Exiled Force"'s effect while "Skill Drain" is active, "Exiled Force" is no longer on the field and you can select and destroy 1 monster on the field. If you Tribute "Paladin of White Dragon" to activate its effect while "Skill Drain" is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". If you Tribute "Great Dezard" while "Skill Drain" is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon "Fushioh Richie".
*   "Skill Drain" will negate Flip Effects, and you can chain the activation of "Skill Drain" to the activation of a Flip Effect, but you cannot activate "Skill Drain" in the Damage Step because it does not specifically modify ATK or DEF, so you cannot chain "Skill Drain" to a Flip Effect that is activated because a monster was attacked while face-down.
*   If you Flip Summon "Spear Cretin" while "Skill Drain" is active, "Spear Cretin"'s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and "Skill Drain" negates Flip Effects.
*   "Skill Drain" negates Multi-Trigger Effects such as "Dark Paladin" and "Ryu Senshi".
*   While "Skill Drain" is active you cannot Tribute a face-up "Kaiser Seahorse" to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher LIGHT monster. However, you can Tribute a face-down "Kaiser Seahorse".
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, "maintenance costs" are not negated (see the Advanced Gameplay FAQ) so you still have to pay for "The Unfriendly Amazon", "Armor Exe", Archfiends, etc. However, all other costs are negated, so you do not have to pay to attack with "Dark Elf" or "Jirai Gumo".
*   Restrictions are also lifted, so you can attack with "Ultimate Obedient Fiend" even if you have other cards on your side of the field.
*   Spirit Monsters are not returned to the owner's hand while "Skill Drain" is active.
*   Toon Monsters' effects are negated while "Skill Drain" is active and the Toon Monster is on the field, so they can attack the same turn they are Summoned, you do not have to pay 500 Life Points to attack with them, and they are not destroyed if "Toon World" is destroyed, but they cannot attack your opponent directly.
*   "Jinzo" cannot negate Trap Cards while "Skill Drain" is already active, because "Skill Drain" is negating "Jinzo"'s effect. But if "Jinzo" is already on the field, you cannot activate "Skill Drain" because "Jinzo"'s effect prevents you from doing so.
*   When a monster's ATK or DEF are changed by its own effect, like "Slate Warrior" or "Berserk Dragon", and "Skill Drain" is activated, that monster's effect is negated and the ATK/DEF are returned to normal. Even if "Skill Drain" is then destroyed, the old adjustment to ATK/DEF does not come back. Any bonuses or penalties are lost when "Skill Drain" effect is applied, and you have to start over from the beginning.
*   If your opponent uses "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s effect to increase its ATK, and you use "Skill Drain", "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s ATK returns to normal, even if "Skill Drain" is destroyed after resolving. If "Skill Drain" is negating "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s effect, you can still pay the cost and remove monsters in your Graveyard from play, but "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"'s ATK will not increase.
*   "Goblin Attack Force" and "Spear Dragon" do not change their battle position after attacking while "Skill Drain" is active. If "Goblin Attack Force" attacks and changes battle position, then on your next turn you activate "Skill Drain", you can change "Goblin Attack Force" back to Attack Position because its effect that prevents this is negated.
*   Monsters equipped to "Relinquished" while "Skill Drain" is active are negated and destroyed because "Relinquished" no longer has an effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and "Relinquished"'s ATK and DEF are returned to normal.
*   Monsters that can hold Spell Counters, like "Skilled Dark Magician", no longer have that effect while "Skill Drain" is active, so they cannot gain more Spell Counters and all Spell Counters already placed on them are removed.
*   If a face-down "Kisetai" is attacked while "Skill Drain" is active, the effect of "Kisetai" is negated, damage calculation is performed, and "Kisetai" will not equip itself to the attacking monster. But if "Kisetai" is already an Equip Spell Card, and "Skill Drain" is activated, Kisetai is unaffected because it is no longer an Effect Monster.
*   The effects of "Zombyra the Dark" are negated while "Skill Drain" is active, so "Zombyra the Dark" can attack your opponent directly, and its ATK is not decreased because of its effect. If "Skill Drain" is destroyed, "Zombyra the Dark"'s ATK is not changed.
*   The ATK and DEF of "Gradius' Option", the ATK of "Maju Garzett", and similar monsters is 0 while "Skill Drain" is active, and is not restored even if "Skill Drain" is destroyed.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after "Hayabusa Knight"'s first attack, "Hayabusa Knight" does not get its second attack.
*   You can Special Summon "Gilasaurus" while "Skill Drain" is active, but its effect is negated so your opponent does not get to Special Summon.
*   Do not roll dice for Archfiends while "Skill Drain" is active.
*   A Union Monster that attached itself to another monster before "Skill Drain" became active is unaffected by "Skill Drain". If "Skill Drain" is active, you can activate a Union Monster's effect to attach it to another monster, but nothing happens and it remains a monster.
*   "Skill Drain" will not affect lingering effects or conditions that are left over from a previous effect. For example, if you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with "Summoner of Illusions", and then "Skill Drain" is activated afterwards, the Fusion Monster is still destroyed in the End Phase. If you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with "Magical Scientist", and then "Skill Drain" is activated, the Fusion Monster cannot attack your opponent's Life Points directly, and is returned to the Fusion Deck at the end of the turn.
*   When "Jowls of Dark Demise"'s effect is activated and resolves, and then "Skill Drain" is activated afterwards, it has no effect on "Jowls of Dark Demise"'s effect, so control of the monster does not change until it is returned to the original controller at the end of the turn.
*   If "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi"'s effect is activated, and then "Skill Drain" is activated later, "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi"'s effect is not negated and the opponent must discard his/her hand during their next Draw Phase. But if "Skill Drain" is active at the time "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi"'s effect activates, then the effect is negated.
*   Conditions for Summoning monsters is not negated by "Skill Drain", so you still must remove 1 DARK and 1 LIGHT monster to Special Summon "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", and you cannot Normal Summon or Flip Summoning "Terrorking Archfiend" if there are no Archfiends on the field.
*   You can have 2 "Gravekeeper's Chiefs" on the field while "Skill Drain" is active, but if "Skill Drain" is destroyed, select 1 of the "Gravekeeper's Chiefs" and destroy it.

#### SKILLED DARK MAGICIAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You place a Spell Counter on this monster when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Skilled Dark Magician, "Skilled Dark Magician" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Skilled Dark Magician" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.
*   You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.
*   When you use the effect of a Continuous Spell Card that is already face-up on the field, such as "Inspection", or sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard, or paying for "Messenger of Peace", you do NOT place a Spell Counter on this monster.
*   When "Double Spell" is played, you get a Spell Counter on this monster for the activation of "Double Spell", but not for the target of "Double Spell" because the target is never activated; so you get 1 Spell Counter on this monster.
*   You do not place a Spell Counter on this monster when you attach or detach a Union Monster because that is not the activation of a Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" to revive this monster, this monster does not get a Spell Counter for "Monster Reborn" (it has to be face-up on the field before the activation of the Spell Card).
*   You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.
*   This monster's effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon "Dark Magician" from your Graveyard and your opponent chains "Disappear" and removes that "Dark Magician", you can Special Summon a different "Dark Magician" from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.
*   If there is no "Dark Magician" in your hand/Deck/Graveyard you can still activate this effect but your opponent can verify the contents to make certain, and then the effect disappears.
*   When "Skill Drain" is active, and you or your opponent activates a Spell Card, do not place Spell Counters on this monster. Any Spell Counters that are on this monster are removed when "Skill Drain" is activated.
*   If a player controls the opponent's "Skilled Dark Magician" and Tribute it with 3 Spell Counters, the player who controlled and Tributed the "Skilled Dark Magician" is the player who Special Summons "Dark Magician" from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

#### SKILLED WHITE MAGICIAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You place a Spell Counter on this monster when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Skilled White Magician", "Skilled White Magician" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Skilled White Magician" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.
*   You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.
*   When you use the effect of a Continuous Spell Card that is already face-up on the field, such as "Inspection", or sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard, or paying for "Messenger of Peace", you do NOT place a Spell Counter on this monster.
*   When "Double Spell" is played, you get a Spell Counter on this monster for the activation of "Double Spell", but not for the target of "Double Spell" because the target is never activated; so you get 1 Spell Counter on this monster.
*   You do not place a Spell Counter on this monster when you attach or detach a Union Monster because that is not the activation of a Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" to revive this monster, this monster does not get a Spell Counter for "Monster Reborn" (it has to be face-up on the field before the activation of the Spell Card).
*   You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.
*   This monster's effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon "Buster Blader" from your Graveyard and your opponent chains "Disappear" and removes that "Buster Blader", you can Special Summon a different "Buster Blader" from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.
*   If there is no "Buster Blader" in your hand/Deck/Graveyard you can still activate this effect but your opponent can verify the contents to make certain, and then the effect disappears.
*   When "Skill Drain" is active, and you or your opponent activates a Spell Card, do not place Spell Counters on this monster. Any Spell Counters that are on this monster are removed when "Skill Drain" is activated.
*   If a player controls the opponent's "Skilled White Magician" and Tribute it with 3 Spell Counters, the player who controlled and Tributed the "Skilled White Magician" is the player who Special Summons "Buster Blader" from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

#### SKULL ARCHFIEND OF LIGHTNING

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a player does not have enough Life Points to remain above 0 Life Points during the Standby Phase to pay for “Skull Archfiend of Lightning,” “Skull Archfiend of Lightning” is destroyed.
*   The die roll effect of “Skull Archfiend of Lightning” does not apply to a face-down “Skull Archfiend of Lightning.”

#### SKULL KNIGHT #2

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you Tribute Set a high level Fiend-Type monster by Tributing this card, you CAN Special Summon another "Skull Knight #2" from your Deck and you do NOT have to reveal your Set monster to prove it is a Fiend-Type.
*   If you activate "Change of Heart" to control your opponent’s "Skull Knight #2" and Tribute it to Tribute Summon a Fiend-Type monster you can Special Summon a "Skull Knight #2" from your Deck. But if you activate "Soul Exchange" to Tribute a "Skull Knight #2" on your opponent’s side of the field, neither player can activate its effect.
*   If this card is used as a Tribute for a Special Summon, such as a Ritual Summon, the effect of this card is not activated.
*   If the Tribute Summon of a Fiend-Type monster is negated by "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven", the effect of "Skull Knight #2" will not activate.
*   If the opponent chains "Torrential Tribute" to the effect of "Skull Knight #2", all monsters will be destroyed (including the Level 5 or higher Fiend-Type monster that was Tribute Summoned) and then "Skull Knight #2" will be Special Summoned from your Deck. If the opponent waits until the effect of "Skull Knight #2" resolves and another copy is Special Summoned, and then activates "Torrential Tribute" in response to that Summon, all the monsters will be destroyed.

#### SKYSCRAPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The ATK increase of “Skyscraper” is a Continuous Effect and does not start a chain.
*   If “Skyscraper” is on the field and you attack a Defense Position monster with an “Elemental Hero” that has ATK lower than the ATK of the Defense Position monster, the “Elemental Hero” gains +1000 ATK even though it was attacking a Defense Position monster.
*   If your opponent’s monster’s ATK is increased during the damage step, like “Injection Fairy Lily” or “Covering Fire”, your “Elemental Hero” will gain the +1000 ATK for “Skyscraper”.

#### SLATE WARRIOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Blade Knight" destroys a Flip Effect Monster like "Slate Warrior", even that monster’s non-Flip effects are negated. So in this case, "Slate Warrior" does not reduce the ATK and DEF of the "Blade Knight" that destroyed it, because "Blade Knight" negates its effect.
*   "Gorgon’s Eye" cannot negate the effect of "Sangan", "Witch of the Black Forest", or "Sinister Serpent" because they activate in the Graveyard. If a Defense Position "Slate Warrior" is attacked and destroyed, the effect of "Slate Warrior" that lowers ATK and DEF is applied because it activates in the Graveyard.
*   If "Grave Protector" is on the field, the effect of "Slate Warrior" that reduces the ATK and DEF of the monster that destroys "Slate Warrior" is still applied, even though "Slate Warrior" is shuffled back into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard. The timing of "Slate Warrior’s" effect is still at the end of the Damage Step (when monsters are normally sent to the Graveyard after battle).
*   When a monster's ATK or DEF are changed by its own effect, like "Slate Warrior" or "Berserk Dragon", and "Skill Drain" is activated, that monster's effect is negated and the ATK/DEF are returned to normal. Even if "Skill Drain" is then destroyed, the old adjustment to ATK/DEF does not come back. Any bonuses or penalties are lost when "Skill Drain" effect is applied, and you have to start over from the beginning.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Slate Warrior” is flipped as a result of battle, “Slate Warrior’s” ATK and DEF bonus will resolve after Damage Calculation.
*   “Slate Warrior’s” "destroyed in battle" effect is not dependent upon “Slate Warrior” being flipped.

#### SMOKE GRENADE OF THE THIEF

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card must be destroyed directly for its effect to activate, such as with the effects of "Mystical Space Typhoon", "Heavy Storm", or "Gearfried the Iron Knight". Its effect does NOT activate if the monster it is equipped to is destroyed, Tributed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field.
*   If your opponent chains "Magic Jammer", "Magic Drain", etc., to negate and destroy this card, its effect does not activate.
*   If the opponent chains "Dust Tornado" or "Mystical Space Typhoon" to the activation of "Smoke Grenade of the Thief", it is destroyed and its effect is NOT activated. This is because it is an Equip Spell Card, and must be on the field when it resolves for its effect to activate.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active on the field, the effect of "Smoke Grenade of the Thief" is not activated, even if it is destroyed by a card effect.

#### SNATCH STEAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your opponent's monster on your side of the field that you control with "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal" is removed with "Different Dimension Gate", it returns to your side of the field when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed, and then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   If your opponent equips “Snatch Steal” to your “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, the effect of “Snatch Steal” resolves first and control changes. Then the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates and your opponent gets to select which monster is destroyed.
*   If you control your opponent's monster because of "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal", and remove the monster with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", the monster returns to your side of the field, then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   When your opponent activates "Snatch Steal", and you chain "Ojama Trio" to fill up his/her remaining Monster Zones, then there is no room for the stolen monster, and it is destroyed.
*   When "Snatch Steal" is active, the +1000 Life Points effect is applied even if "Remove Brainwashing" has returned control of the monster to the original owner.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If more than one “Snatch Steal” is equipped to the same monster, the later “Snatch Steal” will take precedence for purposes of determining control.
*   If “Snatch Steal” leaves the field, the monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” will return to the control of the previous controller.
*   If the monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” is turned face-down, “Snatch Steal” will be sent to the Graveyard and the monster will remain under the control of the controller of “Snatch Steal.”
*   If a monster equipped with “Snatch Steal” changes control via “Creature Swap,” “Snatch Steal” will remain equipped to the original monster, but control will not shift back. The opponent of the controller of “Snatch Steal” will continue to regain 1000 LP per Standby Phase as long as “Snatch Steal” remains on the field.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a player has all 5 Monster Zone spaces full when their opponent’s “Snatch Steal” is destroyed, what will happen to the monster their opponent was controlling with the destroyed “Snatch Steal”?  
    A: The returning monster would be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/28/2004
*   Q: If I have used “Snatch Steal” on a monster from another turn and activate “Tailor of the Fickle” on “Snatch Steal,” can I steal another monster and keep both, or do I only get one?  
    A: You would keep the new equipped monster. The monster formerly equipped with “Snatch Steal” would return to your opponent's side of the field. Steve Okegawa, 12/14/2003
*   Q: Can “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” be activated to destroy an opponent’s monster if all 5 Monster Zone spaces are full or does it only happen during the resolution of a chain?  
    A: It is during the resolution of a chain. If you do not have any empty zones in your Monster Zone you cannot activate "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal" to take control of an opponent's monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004
*   Q: Say Player A plays “Snatch Steal” on Player B’s “Jinzo”. Then Player B uses “Change of Heart” on “Jinzo” and then “Book of Moon”. What would happen to “Jinzo”?  
    A: During the End Phase “Jinzo” would return to the previous controller. Player A, based on your example. Curtis Schultz, 01/18/2004

#### SOLAR FLARE DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have 2 "Solar Flare Dragons", or a "Solar Flare Dragon" equipped with "Raregold Armor" and another Pyro-Type monster, your opponent cannot attack.
*   Even if "Solar Flare Dragon"'s Type is changed, as long as there is another Pyro-Type monster on your side of the field, "Solar Flare Dragon" cannot be attacked.
*   You can apply "Barrel Behind the Door" to the effect of "Solar Flare Dragon".

#### SOLEMN JUDGMENT

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Solemn Judgment” can not be used to negate a Special Summon if that Special Summon occurs as a result of another card effect.
*   Special Summon monsters like “Dark Necrofear” that have their summons negated by “Solemn Judgment” are not considered properly summoned and may not be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a person uses “Solemn Judgment” and the resulting Life Points results in a decimal, what happens? Does it round up or down?  
    A: If equal or more than 0.5, round up. If less than 0.5, round down. bishop, 01/20/2004

#### SOLEMN WISHES

Netrep Rulings:

*   The Life Point gain of Solemn Wishes is per instance of drawing, not per card.

#### SOLOMON'S LAWBOOK

Netrep Rulings:

*   Payments that would occur during the Standby Phase skipped due to “Solomon’s Lawbook” do not occur.

#### SONIC JAMMER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you activate "Sonic Jammer" during your turn, it lasts until the end of your opponent's End Phase. If you activate "Sonic Jammer" during your opponent's turn, it lasts until the end of your End Phase.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after "Sonic Jammer"'s effect has resolved, the effect of "Sonic Jammer" is not negated because "Skill Drain" was not active when "Sonic Jammer" was flipped, activated its effect, and applied its effect.
*   While "Sonic Jammer"'s effect is applied, your opponent can still use the effects of "Wave Motion Cannon", or "Black Pendant" when sent to the Graveyard, or Field Spell Cards like "Fusion Gate".
*   While "Sonic Jammer"'s effect is applied, your opponent cannot activate "Spiritualism".

#### SOUL ABSORPTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Soul Absorption"'s effect is based on the number of cards, not on each "lump sum" of cards. So if 3 DARK monsters are removed from the Graveyard to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear", the controller of "Soul Absorption" gains 1500 Life Points.
*   However, you receive the Life Points from "Soul Absorption" as a "lump sum", so in the case of "Dark Necrofear" you gain 1500 Life Points but your "Fire Princess" would only do 500 points of damage.
*   "Soul Absorption" is a "trigger-like" Continuous Spell Card, not a "continuous-like" Continuous Spell Card, so activate its effect after the current chain resolves that includes removing cards from play.
*   The effect of "Soul Absorption" can, itself, be chained to after it activates.
*   If "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates in response to the Special Summon of a monster like "Dark Necrofear" or "Inferno", Soul Absorption's effect activates after the monster is Special Summoned.
*   For "Chaosrider Gustapth", activate "Soul Absorption"'s effect after "Chaosrider Gustaph"'s effect resolves.
*   Your "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates even when your opponent's cards are removed.

#### SOUL DEMOLITION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If either player has no monsters in their Graveyard, the effect of this card cannot be activated.
*   If "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" is on the field, the effect of this card cannot be activated.
*   Paying 500 Life Points is a cost.
*   You must select the monster in the Graveyard you wish to target when you activate this card’s effect. You select before the opponent does. After you select the opponent may chain, with a card like "Dust Tornado", to destroy "Soul Demolition". In this case its effect will not resolve and no monsters will be removed. This is because it is a Continuous Trap Card and it must remain on the field for its effect to resolve. If the effect is negated you do not get a refund of the 500 Life Point cost.
*   If the opponent chains to the effect of "Soul Demolition" with an effect that destroys all the Fiend-Type monsters on your side of the field, the effect of "Soul Demolition" resolves because the activation conditions were correct at the time.
*   If you chain the effect of "Soul Demolition" to "Monster Reborn" and remove the monster targeted by "Monster Reborn" from play, the effect of "Monster Reborn" disappears.

#### SOUL EXCHANGE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "Soul Exchange" during your Main Phase and use its effect to Tribute your opponent’s monster for "Ectoplasmer" during the End Phase.
*   If you activated “Soul Exchange” targeting your opponent’s monster, if the monster is face-down, you cannot Tribute it as a cost for “Metamorphosis”.
*   Since "Soul Exchange" targets, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The player activating “Soul Exchange” must declare a target at the time “Soul Exchange” is activated.
*   If the monster targeted by “Soul Exchange” leaves the field before it is Tributed, that effect of “Soul Exchange” disappears. “Soul Exchange” will still force the player to skip his or her Battle Phase.
*   If the effect of “Soul Exchange” is not used in the turn that “Soul Exchange” has been activated, the effect of “Soul Exchange” disappears.
*   Monsters targeted by “Soul Exchange” may be used for a Ritual Summon.
*   If “Soul Exchange” targets “Spirit Reaper,” “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: When is the monster targeted by “Soul Exchange” Tributed?  
    A: The monster targeted by "Soul Exchange" remains on the field until you actually use it for the Tribute. The monster is not automatically Tributed when "Soul Exchange" resolves. Curtis Schultz, 02/12/2004

#### SOUL RELEASE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Soul Release” is a targeting effect.
*   “Soul Release” may remove any number of cards from the Graveyard from 1 to 5.

#### SOUL REVERSAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Soul Reversal"'s effect targets.

#### SOUL-ABSORBING BONE TOWER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor" and a Zombie-Type monster, your opponent cannot attack. Even if you have a Zombie-Type monster, "Gemini Elf", and a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor", your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have another Zombie-Type monster and "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", your opponent cannot attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", but if you equip the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" with "Ring of Magnetism" your opponent can declare an attack but must attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with the "Ring of Magnetism".
*   If you have multiple "Soul-Absorbing Bone Towers" and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack.
*   When your opponent attacks your "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and during the Battle Step you activate "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon another Zombie-Type monster, then a replay occurs (and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard).
*   If "DNA Surgery" is in play changing all monsters to Zombie-Types, and a monster that was not originally a Zombie-Type is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is applied and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned on your opponent's side of the field, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect activates.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned face-down (with "The Shallow Grave", etc.) then "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect does not activate.
*   If multiple Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is only applied once (so send just 2 cards).
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Special Summoned by itself, its effect is not applied for its own Special Summon.
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and several other Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously (with "Cyber Jar"), that Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower's effect is not applied.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" in play and "The Kick Man" is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is Step 1 of a chain and "The Kick Man"'s effect is Step 2.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and "Card of Safe Return", and a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Step 1 of the chain and "Card of Safe Return" is Step 2.
*   You can chain to "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect that sends 2 cards to the Graveyard.

#### SPARK BLASTER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “Spark Blaster” targets.
*   You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” multiple times in the same Main Phase. You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” during the same turn you played it from your hand.
*   You can chain to “Spark Blaster” when its effect is used. After its effect is used 3 times, you cannot chain to the destruction of “Spark Blaster”.
*   If “Silent Swordsman LV7” is on the field when “Spark Blaster’s” effect is used for the third time, “Spark Blaster” is still destroyed normally.
*   If you chain to the effect of “Spark Blaster” with “Emergency Provisions” and send “Spark Blaster” to your Graveyard, because “Spark Blaster” is no longer on the field its effect disappears.

#### SPATIAL COLLAPSE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Spatial Collapse" is activated, and an effect is chained so that a player has more than 5 cards on the field after "Spatial Collapse" resolves, the controller selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.
*   You can activate "Spatial Collapse" when you have 5 or less cards on the field and your opponent has 5 or less cards on the field.
*   "Spatial Collapse" includes Tokens, too.
*   While "Spatial Collapse" is active and you have 1 or more cards already on your side of the field, you cannot activate "Scapegoat" because you would have your 1 previous card + the "Scapegoat" card + 4 monster tokens = 6.
*   When you have 4 cards on your side of the field while "Spatial Collapse" is active, you cannot activate "Change of Heart".
*   When "Cyber Jar" is activated while "Spatial Collapse" is active, if the number of cards exceeds 5, each player selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.
*   When you have 4 cards on the field and you activate "Remove Brainwashing", you select cards to destroy to make the number of cards you control 5.

Netrep Rulings:

*   While “Spatial Collapse” is active, cards that Special Summon a monster may not be activated if that player’s filled zones are 4.
*   The zones prohibited by “Ground Collapse” do not count toward the affected player’s limit for “Spatial Collapse,” unless a monster already occupies that zone.

#### SPEAR CRETIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Blade Knight" destroys "Spear Cretin", "Spear Cretin"’s effect is not applied.
*   When a card that selects a card in the Graveyard as a target, such as "Monster Reborn", "Mask of Darkness", "Magician of Faith", "Spear Cretin", or "The Shallow Grave", is activated, you may chain "Disappear" to remove the targeted card from play, and the "Monster Reborn", etc., will resolve without effect. This is because these cards select their target at activation, not resolution.
*   If you Flip Summon "Spear Cretin" while "Skill Drain" is active, "Spear Cretin"'s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and "Skill Drain" negates Flip Effects.
*   If "The End of Anubis" is face-up on the field when a flipped "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin's" effect does not activate. But if "The End of Anubis" was merely on the field when "Spear Cretin" was flipped, but is NOT on the field when "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin's" effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because "The End of Anubis" is no longer on the field to negate it.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Spear Cretin’s” effect is optional.
*   A player may not choose the same “Spear Cretin” that was destroyed as a target for its effect.
*   A monster destroyed at the same time as “Spear Cretin” may not be chosen as the Special Summon for the effect of “Spear Cretin.”

#### SPEAR DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If "Spear Dragon" attacks, even if the damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku" or "Kuriboh", it is still changed to Defense Position.
*   "Spear Dragon" will change to Defense Position after it attacks, regardless of the battle position of the opponent’s monster.
*   The effect of "Spear Dragon" does not prevent you from manually changing its battle position later on. Of course, you cannot change it in the same turn after you attacked with "Spear Dragon". But during your next turn you can change it back to Attack Position (and attack again the same turn, if you choose).
*   If you attack your opponent’s Defense Position monster with 0 DEF with your "Spear Dragon", and have "Dragon’s Rage" active on the field, the opponent only takes 1900 points of damage. The effects are not cumulative.
*   The effect of "Lord of D." will not prevent the effect of "Spear Dragon" from changing it to Defense Position after it attacks.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If the attack of “Spear Dragon” is negated, “Spear Dragon” does not change to defense position.

#### SPECIAL HURRICANE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Special Hurricane" will destroy face-down monsters that were Special Summoned.
*   If a monster is Special Summoned, then removed from the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", and returns to the field, "Special Hurricane" WILL destroy it if activated after it returns to the field.

#### SPELL ABSORPTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Spell Absorption” is applied when the Spell Card is activated. You cannot chain to this effect. The effect is applied immediately. For example, when activating “Tribute to the Doomed” while “Spell Absorption” is on the field: (1) pay the cost by discarding a card, (2) activate “Tribute to the Doomed”, (3) your Life Points increase for “Spell Absorption”, (4) check for chaining and resolve “Tribute to the Doomed”.
*   If the activation of a Spell Card is negated by “Magic Jammer”, etc., then you will not gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption”.
*   A Spell Card used from the Graveyard by the effect of “Double Spell” is not considered “activated”, so you will only gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption” for “Double Spell” itself, not for the card used from the Graveyard.
*   When you activate “Spell Absorption”, you do not gain Life Points for activating “Spell Absorption” itself.

#### SPELL CANCELLER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Spell Canceller"'s effect is similar to "Imperial Order".
*   If "Last Will"'s effect is active (its 'state' is in effect) and "Spell Canceller" is Summoned, "Spell Canceller" will not negate the effect of "Last Will".
*   You can Special Summon "Spell Canceller" with "Premature Burial"; the effect of "Premature Burial" is negated by "Spell Canceller" so if "Premature Burial" is destroyed, "Spell Canceller" is not destroyed and remains on the field.
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to a Spell Card, and Special Summon "Spell Canceller", to negate the effect of the Spell Card.
*   You can activate "Spiritualism" when "Spell Canceller" is face-up on the field because its activation and effect cannot be negated.
*   When "Spell Canceller" is face-up on the field, you can activate the Graveyard effect of "Dark Necrofear" (because it is a monster effect) and equip it to a monster, but the effect of "Dark Necrofear" after it is equipped will be negated because it is then an Equip Spell Card.

#### SPELL ECONOMICS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Spell Economics" is active, you don't have to pay Life Points to activate a Spell Card (place it face-up on the field), but to activate an effect of a Spell Card, like "Archfiend's Oath", you still have to pay.
*   Only the controller of "Spell Economics" gets its effect.
*   You have to pay for "Chain Energy" even if you control "Spell Economics".
*   You pay the 500 Life Points to restore "Horn of Light" to your Deck even if "Spell Economics" is on the field.

#### SPELL SHIELD TYPE-8

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Discarding a Spell Card for "Spell Shield Type-8" is a cost.

#### SPELL VANISHING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you activate "Spell Vanishing", you get to search your opponent's Deck to look for any Spell Cards of the same name as the destroyed Spell Card.

#### SPELLBINDING CIRCLE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Battle Position of a monster targeted by this card can still be changed by card effects, such as "Book of Moon", "Stop Defense", etc.
*   This card may select a face-down monster as a target. This prevents the monster from being Flip Summoned, but it will still be flipped face-up if it is the target of an attack.
*   If the targeted monster is Tributed, changed into an Equip Spell Card by the effect of "Relinquished", returned to the owner’s hand, or otherwise removed from the field without being destroyed, "Spellbinding Circle" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   You can chain "Spellbinding Circle" to the activation of a Flip Effect when a monster is Flip Summoned or flipped face-up, but it will not negate the activation or resolution of the Flip Effect.
*   You can activate "Change of Heart" and take control of a monster targeted by "Spellbinding Circle" but you cannot attack with it or change its Battle Position.
*   If a monster attacks and you activate "Spellbinding Circle", the monster’s attack stops.

#### SPHINX TELEIA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card’s effect which allows you to Special Summon it is a Spell Speed 1 effect that you can only activate during your Main Phase 1 or 2.

#### SPIRAL SPEAR STRIKE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Spiral Spear Strike” that causes you to draw can be chained to. But the first effect is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   If you have 2 copies of “Spiral Spear Strike”, or “Spiral Spear Strike” and a “Gaia the Dragon Champion” equipped with “Fairy Meteor Crush”, the damage to your opponent’s Life Points is not doubled. (In the case of “Fairy Meteor Crush”, you still can draw for the “Spiral Spear Strike” effect.)

#### SPIRIT BARRIER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You still perform damage calculation with "Spirit Barrier" even though the damage to the controller’s Life Points becomes zero.
*   If you have 1 monster on the field, and "Airknight Parshath" attack and destroys it, and would do extra damage, there is still a monster on the field when "Airknight Parshath"’s effect would activate and resolve, so "Spirit Barrier"’s effect is applied, "Airknight Parshath" inflicts zero damage to your Life Points, and your opponent does not draw 1 card for "Airknight Parshath"’s effect.

#### SPIRIT ELIMINATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   During the turn that "Spirit Elimination" is activated; all monsters removed from play must be from your side of the field. This means that you cannot activated "Soul Release" and remove two monsters from your side of the field and three from your Graveyard.
*   Any conditions set on the Monster Cards that would be removed from the Graveyard must still be fulfilled on the Monsters removed from your side of the field. For example, to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear" you must remove 3 Fiend-Type Monsters from your side of the field.
*   You can activate "Spirit Elimination" while "Necrovalley" is active.

#### SPIRIT MESSAGE "A"

Netrep Rulings:

*   Spirit Messages may not be placed on the field except as a result of the effect of “Destiny Board.”
*   The placement of Spirit Messages cannot be negated.

#### SPIRIT MONSTERS

The following rules apply to all Spirit Monsters:

*   Spirit is not a monster Type; you cannot declare "Spirit" for the effect of "DNA Surgery".
*   Spirit Monsters are still Effect Monsters.
*   A Spirit Monster must be face-up on the field during the End Phase for it to return to the owner’s hand. If it was destroyed or removed from play, it will not return to the owner’s hand.
*   A Spirit Monster will return to the owner’s hand during the End Phase, even if the opponent played it from their hand (through the effect of "Exchange".)

#### SPIRIT OF THE PHARAOH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Spirit of the Pharaoh" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "The First Sarcophagus". So "Spirit of the Pharaoh" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   If your opponent chains "Royal Decree" to the effect of "The First Sarcophagus", the effect of Special Summoning is negated and "The First Sarcophagus" is sent to the Graveyard because that is the cost.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is in play and you activate "The First Sarcophagus", you cannot Special Summon "Spirit of the Pharaoh".
*   You select the Zombie-Type monsters when you successfully Special Summon "Spirit of the Pharaoh", then activate his effect.
*   "Spirit of the Pharaoh"'s effect targets.
*   You can choose whether or not to activate "Spirit of the Pharaoh"'s effect, but if you activate it you must Special Summon at least 1 Zombie-Type monster.
*   If you have "Stumbling" on the field and "Spirit of the Pharaoh" is Special Summoned, his effect can be activated but it is a chain with "Stumbling" as Step 1 and "Spirit of the Pharaoh" as Step 2.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster had its Level reduced by "Cost Down", that reduction no longer applies when it is in the Graveyard.
*   If you activate "Spirit of the Pharaoh"'s effect and "Enemy Controller" is chained, and control of "Spirit of the Pharaoh" switches, the effect is still controlled by the activator of "Spirit of the Pharoah"'s effect.

#### SPIRIT OF THE POT OF GREED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect does not chain to "Pot of Greed"; instead, you activate it after "Pot of Greed" resolves.
*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed" must be face-up on the field to resolve its effect; if "Book of Moon" is chained to "Pot of Greed" or to the effect of "Spirit of the Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect is negated.
*   If "Imperial Order" negates the effect of "Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect still activates because "Pot of Greed"'s activation was not negated.

#### SPIRIT REAPER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While in Defense Position, "Spirit Reaper" will stop all Battle Damage to your Life Points from most monsters, but monsters like "Spear Dragon" and those equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush" can still inflict Battle Damage to your Life Points with their effects.
*   If attacked while face-down, "Spirit Reaper" flips face-up and its effect preventing it from being destroyed will be applied during damage calculation, so "Spirit Reaper" will not be destroyed by the attack.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is attacked by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", "Spirit Reaper" isn’t destroyed during damage calculation, so the effect of "Dark Ruler Ha Des" does not activate.
*   When "Spirit Reaper" is targeted by an effect, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect AFTER resolving the effect that targeted it. For example, if "Spirit Reaper" attacks and "Magic Cylinder" is activated, designating "Spirit Reaper", first "Magic Cylinder" will resolve, negate the attack, and inflict 300 damage to the controller of "Spirit Reaper". Then, after that, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its effect.
*   "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect after a card that targets it resolves. If a Spell Card targets it, and the activation of that Spell Card is negated (such as with "Magic Jammer"), then "Spirit Reaper" is not destroyed. However, if the effect of the Spell Card was negated, such as if "Imperial Order" is active, then "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed because the Spell Card resolves (even though its effect is negated). Even if "Imperial Order" is already active on the field, you can activate a card such as "Tribute to the Doomed" designating "Spirit Reaper", and "Spirit Reaper" will be destroyed by its own effect.
*   "Spirit Reaper" is only destroyed by its own effect if it is face-up on the field when the effect designating it as a target activates, AND after the effect designating it as a target resolves. If you Special Summon "Spirit Reaper" with Monster Reborn, or flip it face-down with "Book of Moon", or flip it face-up with "Book of Taiyou", it is not destroyed. If a face-down "Spirit Reaper" is targeted with "Change of Heart", then Flip Summoned, it is not destroyed because it was face-down when "Change of Heart" was activated. If "Spirit Reaper" is targeted by the effect of "Relinquished", "Spirit Reaper" is an Equip Spell Card after the effect of "Relinquished" resolves, so it is not destroyed. If "Spirit Reaper" is removed from play with "Dimensionhole" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Different Dimension Gate", then it is removed from play so it is not destroyed. If "Spirit Reaper" is shuffled into the Deck with "Monster Recovery", it’s not destroyed. If "Spirit Reaper" is returned to the hand with "Penguin Soldier", it’s not destroyed.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its effect during the Damage Step, such as if "Rush Recklessly" was activated to increase its ATK, destroy "Spirit Reaper" with its effect AFTER damage calculation.
*   "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed if equipped, including with "Heart of Clear Water".
*   Examples of cards that will not destroy "Spirit Reaper" because they do not target: "Creature Swap", "Adhesion Trap Hole", "Spear Dragon".
*   Since "Soul Exchange" targets, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.
*   "Spirit Reaper" has a special effect for when it isn’t destroyed (as a result of battle), and a special effect for an extra reason to destroy it (when targeted by an effect). But it can still be destroyed by all other normal effects that would destroy a monster: "Cyber Jar", "Raigeki", etc.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is Special Summoned with "Premature Burial" or "Call of the Haunted", "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed after it is Special Summoned because it is targeted by an effect.
*   "Spirit Reaper" only forces your opponent to discard when "Spirit Reaper" attacks directly (such as when your opponent has no monsters on the field), AND when it inflicts at least 1 point of damage to the opponent’s Life Points. So if your opponent uses "Kuriboh", "Waboku", or "Tornado Wall" to prevent the damage, "Spirit Reaper" does not force the opponent to discard.
*   "Dreamsprite" targets 1 of your own monsters. If "Spirit Reaper" is targeted, it is destroyed after damage calculation.
*   "Patrician of Darkness" does not target, so "Spirit Reaper" is not destroyed if you use "Patrician of Darkness" to force your opponent to attack it.
*   If "Spirit Reaper" is targeted by "Riryoku", it is destroyed, but the increase to the other monster’s ATK lasts until the end of the turn as normal.
*   If a Spellcaster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Spirit Reaper", it’s just a normal attack. "Spirit Reaper" is not being targeted by "Diffusion Wave-Motion".
*   If "Skill Drain" is active, "Spirit Reaper" can be equiped with Equip Cards, but if "Skill Drain" is later removed from the field "Spirit Reaper" wil be destroyed.
*   "Spirit Reaper" can be destroyed as a result of battle while "Skill Drain" is active.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by a card during the Damage Step, Damage Calculation resolves as normal and then “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect.
*   If “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” attacks and targets “Spirit Reaper” with its effect, “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect and a replay will occur.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Bob activates Snatch Steal targeting Spirit Reaper. Andrew chains Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy Snatch Steal. Does Spirit Reaper still destroy itself?  
    A: "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed after the card that targets it resolves. "Snatch Steal" is an Equip Card. Since "Snatch Steal" was destroyed before it could resolve, it's effect disappears and does not resolve. Since "Snatch Steal" doesn't resolve, "Spirit Reaper" is not destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 11/09/2005

#### SPIRIT RYU

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Spirit Ryu’s” effect is considered Spell Speed 1, but may be activated multiple times in the same Battle Phase.

Other Rulings:

*   "Spirit Ryu's" effect can only be activated in the Battle Step. This is where the attack is declared. Because you can activate multiple chains during this step, as long as you have Dragons in your hand, you can discard them 1 at a time to keep \[using\] "Spirit Ryu's" effect. You can't discard, say, 4 in one shot. 1 at a time and your opponent gets the chance to respond/chain. Andrew Roth, 6/21/2005

#### SPIRIT'S INVITATION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can choose not to pay 500 Life Points during your Standby Phase, and destroy this card instead.
*   The effect of this card is applied even when a Spirit Monster is returned to its owner’s hand by the effect of another card, such as "Penguin Soldier".

#### SPIRITUAL EARTH ART - KUROGANE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Tributing a monster is a cost for “Spiritual Earth Art – Kurogane”.
*   You can Tribute a face-down EARTH monster for the cost of “Spiritual Earth Art – Kurogane”.
*   “Spiritual Earth Art – Kurogane” is an effect that targets 1 monster in your Graveyard. (So it will be negated by “Necrovalley” or “The End of Anubis”).

#### SPIRITUAL ENERGY SETTLE MACHINE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When this card is active, Spirit Monsters on both sides of the field do not return to their owner’s hand during the End Phase of the turn they were Summoned.
*   Discarding 1 card during your End Phase is a maintenance cost and must be paid each turn. You may decide to not discard a card, and destroy this card instead.
*   When this card is active, Spirit Monsters may still be returned to their owner’s hands by card effects such as "Penguin Soldier" and "Compulsory Evacuation Device".

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Spiritual Energy Settle Machine” is negated, Spirits summoned that turn will return to the hand as normal. Spirits summoned or turned face up on previous turns will not return to the hand

#### SPIRITUAL WIND ART - MIYABI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “Spiritual Wind Art – Miyabi” is an effect that targets.
*   If you target the opponent’s Fusion Monster for “Spiritual Wind Art – Miyabi”, the Fusion Monster is placed on the bottom of the Fusion Deck. (Oh no!)

#### SPIRITUALISM

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Spell or Trap Card goes to its owner’s hand (in case your Spell or Trap Card was on your opponent’s side of the field).

#### SPRING OF REBIRTH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Only the controller of "Spring of Rebirth" gains Life Points by its effect. If you control "Spring of Rebirth", you gain Life Points even when a monster is returned to your opponent’s hand.
*   You gain 500 Life Points each time a monster or monsters on the field are returned to their owner’s hand. So if "Penguin Soldier" returns two monsters at once, you only gain 500 Life Points.
*   Spirit Monsters are sent to the owner’s hand one at a time during the End Phase. So if you have 4 face-up Spirit Monsters during the End Phase, you will gain 500 Life Points for each, totaling 2000 Life Points.
*   Multiple "Spring of Rebirth" cards are cumulative.

#### STAMPING DESTRUCTION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you activate this card, if the opponent activates an effect in a chain that destroys the targeted Spell or Trap Card, the opponent will not take the 500 points of damage. If your opponent merely chains the Spell or Trap card that you targeted, the Spell or Trap Card will be destroyed when "Stamping Destruction" resolves and your opponent will take 500 points of damage. (Remember that Spell and Trap Cards remain on the field until the entire chain resolves, unless destroyed by a card effect during the chain.)
*   If your opponent destroys all the Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as a chain to the activation of this card, this card will still resolve since the conditions were met at the time of activation.

#### STATUE OF THE WICKED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card is only activated if sent from the field to the Graveyard. There is no way to activate this card while it is Set on the field.
*   The effect of "Statue of the Wicked" is activated in the Graveyard, so its effect is activated even if "Jinzo" is on the field, because "Jinzo" only applies to Trap Cards and Trap Card effects on the field. Also, cards like "Seven Tools of the Bandit" cannot be used against "Statue of the Wicked".
*   "Statue of the Wicked" activates its effect even if it is destroyed on the same turn it was Set.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is in play, then "Statue of the Wicked" does not activate its effect when destroyed, because it is not sent to the Graveyard.
*   "Statue of the Wicked" activates its effect even if you destroy your own "Statue of the Wicked".
*   You can Tribute a "Wicked Token".

#### STAUNCH DEFENDER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Activating the card causes a replay.
*   Monsters Special Summoned that same turn after activation of "Staunch Defender" must also attack the monster selected by "Staunch Defender".
*   If your monster selected with "Staunch Defender" is destroyed, your opponent's remaining monsters cannot attack.
*   When your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to your "Staunch Defender" to destroy the selected monster, the effect of "Staunch Defender" is negated and battle is conducted normally.
*   While "Staunch Defender" is active, your opponent must still pay costs to attack with "Dark Elf", etc., if he/she attacks with that monster.
*   You cannot select "Guardian Kay'est" or "The Legendary Fisherman" for "Staunch Defender" if they cannot be attacked.
*   You can activate "Staunch Defender" when a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" declares an attack. The monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" will then attack your selected monster once (and only once).
*   When you select "Spirit Reaper" or "The Reaper on the Nightmare" as the target of "Staunch Defender", resolve the chain, and after the effect of "Staunch Defender" resolves, the selected monster is destroyed. A replay will occur, but the opponent can no longer attack because the selected monster is gone.
*   If two "Staunch Defenders" are activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.
*   If "Absolute End" and "Staunch Defender" are both activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters summoned after “Staunch Defender” resolves must attack the designated monster.
*   If the monster designated by “Staunch Defender” is destroyed or leaves the field, the opponent’s monsters may no longer attack.
*   “Staunch Defender” may only designate a legal attack target.
*   Monsters that have attacked before “Staunch Defender” was activated may not attack again, unless that monster was able to attack a second time normally.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” declares an attack and the opponent activates “Staunch Defender”, will all other face-up monsters have to attack?  
    A: It depends on "Thousand Eyes Restrict" surviving the attack. If the "Thousand Eyes Restrict" survives the attack (due to Battle Damage or its effect), then no other monster will be allowed to attack. If it does not survive and is sent to the Graveyard or otherwise removed from the field, then any other face-up monsters on your side of the field would have to attack the selected monster. Curtis Schultz, 02/01/2004

#### STEAMROID

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of “Steamroid” is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.

#### STONE STATUE OF THE AZTECS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The Battle Damage is doubled during damage calculation.
*   When "Amazoness Swordswoman" (1500 ATK) attacks "Stone Statue of the Aztecs" (2000 DEF), the controller of Stone Statue of the Aztecs takes 1000 Battle Damage.

#### STOP DEFENSE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Using "Stop Defense" on a face-down monster does not constitute a Flip Summon, so "Trap Hole" could not be used.

#### STRAY LAMBS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Stray Lambs" the same turn that you Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon. But you can perform a Set the same turn. So you can activate "Stray Lambs" and then Tribute one of them to Set "Labyrinth Wall".
*   You can't activate "Stray Lambs" unless you have at least 2 vacant Monster Card Zones.

#### STRIKE NINJA

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Strike Ninja"'s effect during the Damage Step.

*   You can only activate "Strike Ninja"'s effect when "Strike Ninja" is face-up on the field.
*   Removing 2 DARK monsters for "Strike Ninja"'s effect is a cost.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Strike Ninja” attempts to return to the field when all monster zones are occupied, “Strike Ninja” is destroyed.
*   “Strike Ninja’s” effect only applies while “Strike Ninja” is face up on the field.
*   The effect of “Strike Ninja” returning to the field after being removed by its own effect is not a Special Summon.

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

*   Q: Can "Strike Ninja" return in the End Phase if my monster zones are full from having activated "Return from the Different Dimension" previously this turn?  
    A: Yes. Since both "Strike Ninja" and "Return from the Different Dimension" will resolve in the End Phase you can choose in which order this will happen. You can choose to resolve "Return from the Different Dimension" and then resolve "Strike Ninja". In this instance "Strike Ninja" will return to the field. If you choose to resolve "Strike Ninja" before "Return from the Different Dimension" then it will be sent to the graveyard.

#### STUMBLING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of "Stumbling" goes on a chain immediately after a monster is Summoned. As a mandatory Trigger Effect, "Stumbling" is always on the chain before optional Trigger Effects (“Mobius the Frost Monarch”) or chained Spell & Trap Cards (“Trap Hole”).
*   "Stumbling" changes a monster to face-up Defense Position, not face-down Defense Position.
*   When "Stumbling" and "Final Attack Orders" are both active, a Summoned monster is changed to Defense Position, then changed to Attack Position.
*   If "Stumbling" is in effect and you Summon "Exiled Force", and your opponent has "Trap Hole" Set, "Stumbling" initiates a chain with "Stumbling"'s effect as Step 1. Your opponent can activate "Trap Hole" as Step 2. You cannot chain "Exiled Force" because its effect is Spell Speed 1. Therefore "Trap Hole" will destroy "Exiled Force" before you have a chance to Tribute it.
*   If "Dream Clown" is Summoned while "Stumbling" is active, and changed to Defense Position by "Stumbling"'s effect, "Dream Clown"'s effect activates after "Stumbling"'s effect resolves.

#### SUIJIN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   A marker may be placed on this card to indicate that its effect has been used. The effect resets if the monster is destroyed or removed from the field.

*   The effect of this card targets.

#### SUMMONER OF ILLUSIONS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost.

*   If you use "Dimensionhole" on the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect, it will return during your next Standby Phase and not be destroyed.
*   If the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down it will not be destroyed during your End Phase, since the condition is reset when the monster becomes face-down.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Fiend Skull Dragon” is summoned by the effect of “Summoner of Illusions,” that “Fiend Skull Dragon” will immediately negate the effect of “Summoner of Illusions” and will not be destroyed at the end of the turn.

*   If the effect of "DNA Surgery" is making all monsters on the field Dragon-Type, the ones that are Tributed will count for "Super Rejuvenation".
*   You can activate "Super Rejuvenation" at any time outside the Damage Step, and the effect will be applied during the End Phase.

*   If you have "Solemn Wishes" active on the field, you can increase your Life Points by the number of cards you draw for the effect of "Super Rejuvenation" x 500. So if you drew 2 cards by its effect, you can increase your Life Points by 1000.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Monsters changed to Dragon Type and Tributed are eligible for “Super Rejuvenation’s” effect.
*   Dragon-Type monsters Tributed on the opponent’s field are not counted for the purpose of “Super Rejuvenation.”
*   Dragon-Type monsters Tributed on your field by your opponent, through the effect of “Lava Golem” or similar are counted for “Super Rejuvenation."

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can you play a “Super Rejuvenation” that you drew in the End Phase through the effect of another “Super Rejuvenation”?  
    A: Yes you could. Curtis Schultz, 01/19/2004

The damage points are rounded up when there is a fraction.

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "Sword of the Soul-Eater" even if the monster you're equipping it to is the only monster on the field.

#### SWORDS OF CONCEALING LIGHT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your second Standby Phase after activation of “Swords of Concealing Light” is skipped with “Solomon’s Lawbook”, etc., then “Swords of Concealing Light” is not destroyed and remains active on the field until removed from the field by another effect.
*   While your “Swords of Concealing Light” is active on the field, your opponent can still Summon new monsters in Attack Position.
*   Because “Swords of Concealing Light” is a Continuous Spell Card (unlike “Swords of Revealing Light”), if “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to its activation and destroys it, none of its effects will resolve (including the effect that changes your opponent’s monsters to face-down Defense Position).
*   While “Swords of Concealing Light” is active, monsters can still have their battle positions changed with card effects like “Enemy Controller” and “Bite Shoes”.
*   The effect of “Swords of Concealing Light” that destroys itself in the Standby Phase does not start a chain.
*   Since there’s no such thing as a face-down Monster Token, Monster Tokens are simply changed to Defense Position when the effect of “Swords of Concealing Light” is applied.

#### SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card remains on the field and is active until the end of your opponent’s third turn. This card must be on the field for its effect to be active.
*   If this card is destroyed or removed from the field by the effect of another card, such as "Heavy Storm" or "Giant Trunade", the opponent may then attack.
*   If multiple Flip Effect monsters are flipped face-up by the effect of "Swords of Revealing Light" the effects are activated simultaneously and follow the rules for simultaneous effects found in the "Advanced Gameplay" section of this website.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active on the field you can still activate "Swords of Revealing Light" and it will maintain its turn count, but it will NOT flip monsters face-up or prevent the opponent from attacking. If "Imperial Order" is destroyed after "Swords of Revealing Light" has been on the field for two of your opponent’s turns, it will only prevent your opponent from attacking for one turn and then be destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Swords of Revealing Light” is destroyed but not negated in a chain with its activation, “Swords of Revealing Light” will cause all monsters on the opponent’s field to flip face-up.
*   When the effect of “Swords of Revealing Light” expires, it is sent to the Graveyard regardless if “Swords of Revealing Light” is being negated.

#### SYSTEM DOWN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “System Down” does not remove face-down Machines.
*   “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer” will prevent Machines in the Graveyard from being removed from play for “System Down”, but Machines on the field can still be removed from play by its effect.
*   If your opponent has no Machines in the Graveyard and no Machines on the field, you cannot activate “System Down”.
*   If “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is equipped to a Machine when “System Down” is activated, the equipped monster is removed from play but “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is just destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.

#### T.A.D.P.O.L.E.

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you choose to activate the effect of “T.A.D.P.O.L.E.”, it can be chained to. If you activate the effect, you must add “T.A.D.P.O.L.E.(s)” to your hand.

#### TACTICAL ESPIONAGE EXPERT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this monster prevents the activation of Trap Cards that can be activated when a monster is Normal Summoned, such as "Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute".
*   You can activate Trap Cards later in the turn.
*   You can negate the Normal Summon of this monsters with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment". (In which case the Normal Summon failed and the effect of the monster is not applied.)
*   The effect of this monster is applied to both players (so you cannot activate "Pineapple Blast" in response to your Normal Summon of this monster).
*   This is a Continuous Effect that you cannot chain to.

#### TAILOR OF THE FICKLE

Netrep Rulings:

*   Union monsters may not be moved to another monster with the effect of “Tailor of the Fickle.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can a Union Monster be switched from “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” to its appropriate Monster Card by the effect of “Tailor of the Fickle”?  
    A: No it cannot. Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004

#### TALISMAN OF SPELL SEALING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Royal Decree" and "Talisman of Spell Sealing" are both active, and "Sealmaster Meisei" is removed from the field, "Talisman of Spell Sealing" stays on the field, but if "Royal Decree"'s effect is no longer being applied, "Talisman of Spell Sealing" is destroyed.
*   "Talisman of Spell Sealing" is destroyed immediately when "Sealmaster Meisei" is not on the field. If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to "Talisman of Spell Sealing" to destroy "Sealmaster Meisei", "Talisman of Spell Sealing" is immediately destroyed when "Ring of Destruction" resolves.
*   If you have "Talisman of Spell Sealing" and "Talisman of Trap Sealing", the controller can select which effect will be applied. If both players have both, the turn player chooses which effect is applied.

#### TALISMAN OF TRAP SEALING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Imperial Order" and "Talisman of Trap Sealing" are both active, and "Sealmaster Meisei" is removed from the field, "Talisman of Trap Sealing" stays on the field, but if "Imperial Order"'s effect is no longer being applied, "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is destroyed.
*   "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is destroyed immediately when "Sealmaster Meisei" is not on the field. If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to "Talisman of Trap Sealing" to destroy "Sealmaster Meisei", "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is immediately destroyed when "Ring of Destruction" resolves.
*   If you have "Talisman of Spell Sealing" and "Talisman of Trap Sealing", the controller can select which effect will be applied. If both players have both, the turn player chooses which effect is applied.
*   If you have "Talisman of Trap Sealing" and "Sealmaster Meisei" is destroyed in a battle that causes you to take 2000 or more damage, you cannot activate "Nutrient Z".

#### TAUNT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If a monster selected by "Taunt" is moved to the turn player’s side of the field, the turn player can conduct attacks normally without worrying about the effect of "Taunt", because without a card effect that allows it, a player cannot attack monsters on his own side of the field.
*   If multiple monsters are selected by multiple "Taunts", the turn player selects 1 of the monsters selected by "Taunt" and can attack it.
*   If 1 monster is selected by "Taunt" and another is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", the turn player must attack the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" if he attacks.

#### TERRORKING ARCHFIEND

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When your only Archfiend monster is an Equip Spell Card equipped to "Relinquished", you cannot Normal Summon or Flip Summon "Terrorking Archfiend".
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, you still need to have an Archfiend Monster Card on your side of the field in order to Normal Summon or Flip Summon "Terrorking Archfiend".
*   You can Set or Special Summon a "Terrorking Archfiend" even if there are no Archfiend Monster Cards on your side of the field.

#### THE A. FORCES

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Multiple copies of "The A. Forces" are cumulative. For example, if you control 3 Warrior-Type monsters and have 2 copies of "The A. Forces" active, each Warrior-Type monster has its ATK increased by 1200 points.

Netrep Rulings:

*   "The A. Forces” continuously checks the number of appropriate monsters and alters ATK value accordingly

#### THE AGENT OF CREATION - VENUS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "The Agent of Creation - Venus"' effect multiple times in the same turn.
*   You get the "Mystical Shine Ball" when "The Agent of Creation - Venus"' effect resolves.
*   You have to shuffle your Deck after searching for the "Mystical Shine Ball".
*   After Summoning "The Agent of Creation - Venus", you can activate its effect before your opponent can activate "Trap Hole".
*   You cannot activate "The Agent of Creation - Venus"' effect if there are no "Mystical Shine Balls" in your hand or Deck.

#### THE AGENT OF FORCE - MARS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "The Agent of Force - Mars" is unaffected by Spell Cards just like "Guardian Kay'est" and "The Legendary Fisherman".
*   Vs. "Reverse Trap", "The Agent of Force - Mars"' ATK & DEF become zero but cannot go below zero.
*   If "The Agent of Force - Mars" attacks "Reflect Bounder", "Reflect Bounder" deals damage based on "The Agent of Force - Mars"' current ATK, so if it has 2000 ATK, then "Reflect Bounder" inflicts 2000 damage; then recalculate "The Agent of Force - Mars"' ATK before performing damage calculation.
*   When your face-down Defense Position "The Agent of Force - Mars" is attacked, its DEF is increased BEFORE damage calculation.

#### THE AGENT OF JUDGMENT - SATURN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Tributing "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn" is a cost.
*   You cannot activate "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect during Main Phase 2. You CAN activate "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect during Main Phase 1 even if you have to skip your Battle Phase because of a card effect.
*   You can activate multiple "The Agent of Judgment - Saturns"' effects in the same turn.
*   You can chain "Barrel Behind the Door" to "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect.
*   If you chain "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect and destroy "The Sanctuary in the Sky", "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect disappears but it has already been Tributed so it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   If "The Sanctuary in the Sky" is not on the field, you can Tribute "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn" and activate the effect, but the effect is not applied and disappears.
*   If an effect is chained to "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect that would increase your opponent's Life Points, so that your opponent's Life Points are higher than yours when its effect resolves, then "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect disappears because your Life Points need to be higher than your opponent's when the effect resolves.
*   Damage is calculated and inflicted when the effect resolves, so calculate the exact damage when resolving the effect, including any chained effects that altered the Life Points since activation; if the Life Points have changed since activation, the damage inflicted changes accordingly.

#### THE AGENT OF WISDOM - MERCURY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When it is the END of your opponent's End Phase and you have no hand, then "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect activates. So if you activate "Dust Tornado" during your opponent's End Phase, and Set your last card in your hand, and have no cards at the end of the End Phase, "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect activates.
*   If your hand was increased during the End Phase by activating "Jar of Greed", and you have a card in your hand at the end of the End Phase, then "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect does not activate.
*   If your Standby Phase is skipped then "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect disappears.
*   If you have multiple "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" you can draw multiple times.
*   When the effect of "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" is negated by "Skill Drain", and you have no hand at the end of your opponent's End Phase, and you destroy "Skill Drain" before your "Standby Phase" (such as with "Mystical Space Typhoon" during your Draw Phase), you CAN draw because "Skill Drain" was destroyed. This is because the "when you have no cards in your hand during your opponent's End Phase" is a condition, not an effect, so it is not negated by "Skill Drain". As long as you can make it so that "Skill Drain" is not negating "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s card-drawing effect by the time the Standby Phase begins, you can draw.
*   When you have "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" on your side of the field and you have no cards in your hand at the end of your opponent's End Phase, but it is destroyed before your Standby Phase (such as with "Ring of Destruction" during your Draw Phase), then you do NOT draw during your Standby Phase because "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" is no longer on the field.

#### THE BIG MARCH OF ANIMALS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “The Big March of Animals” applies its effect at resolution of the card and does not recalculate during the turn. Its effect lasts as long as the affected monsters remain face-up on the field, or until the End Phase.
*   “The Big March of Animals” does not affect monsters Summoned after it resolves.
*   “The Big March of Animals” does not count or affect face-down monsters.
*   This is not an effect that targets. It is applied to all face-up Beast-Type monsters on your side of the field.

#### THE CREATOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard is not a cost to activate the effect of "The Creator". It is part of the effect. So if your opponent chains "Disappear" to remove the targeted monster in your Graveyard from play, the effect of "The Creator" disappears and you do not send 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard.
*   If you use the effect of "The Creator", and then it is flipped face-down then flipped face-up again that same turn, you may use the effect of "The Creator" again.
*   If you activate the effect of "The Creator", and it does not resolve because the opponent chains "Skill Drain", or removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard with "Disappear", you’ve still used the effect. So you cannot activate its effect again that turn (even if you destroy "Skill Drain").
*   To Special Summon "The Creator" with the effect of "The Creator Incarnate", you must Tribute a face-up "The Creator Incarnate" from the field, not from your hand, etc.

#### THE CREATOR INCARNATE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Ignition Effects on monsters cannot be activated while the Effect Monster is face-down. So this face-down monster cannot be Tributed for its own effect.

#### THE DARK - HEX-SEALED FUSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you use this monster’s second effect, you also get its first effect. So this monster enables you to perform a Special Summon of a Fusion Monster without “Polymerization”, etc., and also acts as a “substitute” for one of the Fusion Material Monsters.
*   Using the second effect of this monster does not “properly” Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. So it cannot be revived from the Graveyard, etc. If you use “Polymerization” then you can revive the Fusion Monster from the Graveyard, even if you used this monster as a “substitute” Fusion Material Monster.
*   To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “B. Skull Dragon” you must Tribute “The Dark – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “Red-Eyes B. Dragon” or “Summoned Skull”.
*   This monster’s second effect cannot be used to Special Summon Fusion Monsters that can only be Summoned by Fusion Summon, such as “Dark Paladin”.

#### THE DARK DOOR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   A single monster may still attack more than once while this card is on the field, such as "Hayabusa Knight", "Asura Priest", "Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning", a monster equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce" or a Spellcaster-Type Monster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion".
*   If the effect of "Weather Report" is used to gain an additional Battle Phase, one monster may attack once each Battle Phase.

#### THE DRAGON'S BEAD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you first activate this card (flip it face-up) you do not have to activate its effect. You cannot flip this card and activate its effect in the same chain. (See "Chains, Activation, and Resolution" in the Advanced FAQ.)
*   If "The Dragon’s Bead" is already face-up on the field, you may activate it multiple times in the same chain, but you must discard 1 card from you hand as a cost for each activation.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "The Dragon’s Bead" during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "The Dragon’s Bead" to negate a Trap Card that has already resolved, such as a "Nightmare Wheel" the opponent activated on a previous turn.
*   You can only activate the effect of this card to negate a Trap Card that targets a face-up Dragon-Type monster, so it cannot negate "Mirror Force", "Waboku", "Torrential Tribute", "Bottomless Trap Hole", etc.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “The Dragon’s Bead” must already be active to negate a Trap targeting a Dragon-Type.

#### THE EARTH - HEX-SEALED FUSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you use this monster’s second effect, you also get its first effect. So this monster enables you to perform a Special Summon of a Fusion Monster without “Polymerization”, etc., and also acts as a “substitute” for one of the Fusion Material Monsters.
*   Using the second effect of this monster does not “properly” Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. So it cannot be revived from the Graveyard, etc. If you use “Polymerization” then you can revive the Fusion Monster from the Graveyard, even if you used this monster as a “substitute” Fusion Material Monster.
*   To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “Master of Oz” you must Tribute “The Earth – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “Big Koala” or “Des Kangaroo”.
*   This monster’s second effect cannot be used to Special Summon Fusion Monsters that can only be Summoned by Fusion Summon, such as “Dark Paladin”.

#### THE EMPEROR'S HOLIDAY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can chain "The Emperor’s Holiday" to "Premature Burial" and the effect of "Premature Burial" will be negated and the targeted monster will never leave the Graveyard. If "Premature Burial" is already active when you activate "The Emperor’s Holiday" the equipped monster is unaffected.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Union monsters will have their effects negated as long as “The Emperor’s Holiday” is active. Unioned monsters may not return to the monster field as long as “The Emperor’s Holiday” is active.
*   "The Emperor’s Holiday” has no effect on the monster equipped to “Thousand Eyes Restrict.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: What happens to “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?  
    A: The "Butterfly Dagger - Elma's" effect would activate if destroyed while "The Emperor's Holiday" is active. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004
*   Q: What happens to “Dark Necrofear” (as an Equip Spell Card) when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?  
    A: The monster "Dark Necrofear" is equipped would return to its previous controller. The "Dark Necrofear" will remain equipped to the monster. Curtis Schultz, 02/03/2004
*   Q: What happens to “Relinquished” (equipped with an opponent’s monster) when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?  
    A: "Relinquished" will still retain the ATK and DEF stats of the equipped monster. This would be the same as when "Imperial Order" is active. Curtis Schultz, 02/03/2004

#### THE END OF ANUBIS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "The End of Anubis" WILL negate the effects of "Night Assailant" (its second effect), "Aswan Apparition", "Nubian Guard", "Sangan", "Witch of the Black Forest" (even if Tributed to Tribute Summon "The End of Anubis"), "Mystic Tomato"/"Giant Rat"/etc., "Sinister Serpent", "Magician of Faith", "Dark Magician of Chaos"' spell retrieval effect, "Vampire Lord"'s ability to return from the Graveyard, "Dark Necrofear"'s ability to return from the Graveyard, and activation of "Call of the Haunted" or "Premature Burial".
*   "The End of Anubis" WILL NOT negate the Special Summon of "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning", "Dark Necrofear", "Soul of Purity and Light", etc. (because these involve costs, not effects, and "The End of Anubis" cannot negate paying costs). "The End of Anubis" WILL NOT negate "Strike Ninja"'s effect because removing 2 DARK monsters from the Graveyard is a cost.
*   "The End of Anubis" WILL NOT negate the effect of "Fiend Comedian", "Fiber Jar", or "Big Burn".
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to your opponent's effect that targets a card in the Graveyard or activates in the Graveyard to Special Summon "The End of Anubis" and negate that effect.
*   "The End of Anubis" negates the Special Summon effect of "Premature Burial" & "Call of the Haunted", but does not negate the effect that destroys the monster when "Premature Burial"/"Call of the Haunted" is destroyed.
*   While "The End of Anubis" is on the field, if you Special Summon "Gilasaurus", your opponent can't Special Summon.
*   If "The End of Anubis" is face-up on the field when a flipped "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin's" effect does not activate. But if "The End of Anubis" was merely on the field when "Spear Cretin" was flipped, but is NOT on the field when "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin's" effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because "The End of Anubis" is no longer on the field to negate it.
*   When "Night Assailant" is discarded to activate the effect of "Tribe-Infecting Virus", and Fiend is named, the effect of "Night Assailant" is activated after "Tribe-Infecting Virus" resolves because "The End of Anubis" is no longer on the field.
*   You cannot send "Desrook Archfiend" to the Graveyard for its effect while "The End of Anubis" is on the field, because the effect of "Desrook Archfiend" targets the destroyed "Terrorking Archfiend" in the Graveyard.

Judge List Rulings:

*   "Exiled Force", when Tributed for its effect, most certainly DOES activate in the Graveyard. This is the reason that its effect still activates if "Skill Drain" is on the field. Hence, its effect does not \[resolve\] if "The End of Anubis" is on the field. Kevin Tewart, 4/12/2005
*   "The End of Anubis" will not negate the effect of "Wave-Motion Cannon" because the effect of "Wave-Motion Cannon" does not activate in the Graveyard. (This is the exact same reason that "Imperial Order" WILL negate the effect of "Wave-Motion Cannon" even if chained to the act of sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" from the field to the Graveyard.) Kevin Tewart, 10/06/2004

#### THE EYE OF TRUTH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When "The Eye of Truth" is activated in a chain you do not see your opponent’s hand until "The Eye of Truth" resolves. So if "The Eye of Truth" is step 3 in a 5 step chain, steps 5 and 4 will resolve, then "The Eye of Truth" resolves and your opponent reveals his/her hand, then steps 2 and 1 resolve.
*   When "The Eye of Truth" is active and a card such as "Robbin’ Goblin" requires that the opponent discard a card from their hand randomly, the opponent should hide and shuffle his hand, discard a random card, and then reveal their hand again.

#### THE FIEND MEGACYBER

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “The Fiend Megacyber” is summoned through its effect, it is a Special Summon.

#### THE FIRST SARCOPHAGUS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have all 3 Sarcophagi on your side of the field, the effect happens automatically; you have no choice in the matter.
*   If you have multiple copies of "The First Sarcophagus", each will have its own "Second Sarcophagus" and "Third Sarcophagus". So if you have 2 of "TheFirst Sarcophagus", you will have 2 of "The Second Sarcophagus" on the field. If you Special Summon "Spirit of the Pharaoh" or if 1 of the Sarcophagi is removed from the field, all Sarcophagi cards are sent to the Graveyard.
*   If 1 of the Sarcophagi is sent to the Graveyard, all are sent simultaneously, not as a chain.

#### THE FLUTE OF SUMMONING DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "The Flute of Summoning Dragon" if your opponent controls a face-up "Lord of D." and you do not.
*   You must Special Summon at least 1 Dragon-Type monster or you cannot activate this card.

Netrep Rulings:

*   "The Flute of Summoning Dragon” may not Special Summon Dragon Type monsters that have Special Summoning requirements, including Toons.

#### THE FORGIVING MAIDEN

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of “The Forgiving Maiden” may only be used during a player’s Main Phase 1 or Main Phase 2.

#### THE GRAVEYARD IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You select 2 monsters in your Graveyard when you activate "The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension".
*   This card targets 2 cards in the Graveyard.
*   If 1 of the 2 cards targeted by "The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension" is destroyed or removed from the Graveyard, you still add the remaining 1 card to your Deck and shuffle.

#### THE HUNTER WITH 7 WEAPONS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you declare an attack with this card against a monster of the selected Type, and the opponent activates "Mirror Wall", the ATK will be halved first at attack declaration, and then increased by 1000 during damage calculation. So the final ATK will be 1500 = (1000/2) + 1000. Similarly, if the opponent activates the effect of "Fairy Box", the ATK of this card will become 1000, because the 1000 point increase occurs after its ATK is reduced to 0.

#### THE IMMORTAL OF THUNDER

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Dark Ruler Ha Des” destroys “The Immortal of Thunder,” the effect of “The Immortal of Thunder” is negated.
*   If “The Immortal of Thunder’s” Life Gain effect has successfully resolved, the later presence of “Skill Drain” will not prevent the loss of Life Points by the effect of “The Immortal of Thunder” being sent to the Graveyard.

#### THE KICK MAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You select the Spell Card at activation of "The Kick Man"'s effect, so your opponent can chain "Disappear" or "Graverobber" and remove the card you want to equip to him.

#### THE LAST WARRIOR FROM ANOTHER PLANET

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Monsters may still be Set while this card is on the field.
*   This card may be Tributed to Tribute Summon a Level 5 or higher monster.
*   Neither player can activate "Scapegoat", "Magical Hats", "Monster Reborn", etc.
*   If your "Parasite Paracide" in your opponent’s Deck is drawn, it is not Special Summoned. It is instead destroyed and sent to your Graveyard, and no damage is dealt.

Netrep Rulings:

*   As long as “The Last Warrior From Another Planet” is active, neither player may Special Summon a monster.
*   The effect of “The Last Warrior from Another Planet” only prevents Summons. “The Last Warrior from Another Planet” does not prevent monsters from being Flipped by other means.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can you or your opponent use cards that Special Summon monsters face-down like “The Shallow Grave”?  
    A: "The Shallow Grave" is a Special Summon. Neither player can Special Summon any monsters while "The Last Warrior from Another Planet" is face-up on the field. Curtis Schultz, 02/12/2004
*   Q: Can you perform Fusion Summons or Ritual Summons while “The Last Warrior from Another Planet” is on the field?  
    A: Fusion Summons would not be allowed while "The Last Warrior from Another Planet" is face-up on the field. Ritual Summons would not be allowed while "The Last Warrior from Another Planet" is face-up on the field. Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are Special Summons. Curtis Schultz, 02/12/2004

#### THE LAW OF THE NORMAL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The "Law of the Normal" includes Tokens.
*   The "Law of the Normal" also destroys all Spell & Trap Cards.
*   The requirement to have 5 face-up Level 2 or lower Normal Monsters only has to be met when "Law of the Normal" is activated, not when it resolves.

#### THE LEGENDARY FISHERMAN

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Umi” is on the field, and “The Legendary Fisherman” is the only monster on the field, the opponent may attack directly.
*   Equip Spell Cards equipped to “The Legendary Fisherman” while “Umi” is on the field will have no effect on “The Legendary Fisherman.”
*   “The Legendary Fisherman” does not get any bonus from “Umi.”

#### THE LIGHT - HEX-SEALED FUSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you use this monster’s second effect, you also get its first effect. So this monster enables you to perform a Special Summon of a Fusion Monster without “Polymerization”, etc., and also acts as a “substitute” for one of the Fusion Material Monsters.
*   Using the second effect of this monster does not “properly” Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. So it cannot be revived from the Graveyard, etc. If you use “Polymerization” then you can revive the Fusion Monster from the Graveyard, even if you used this monster as a “substitute” Fusion Material Monster.
*   To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “St. Joan” you must Tribute “The Light – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “The Forgiving Maiden” or “Marie the Fallen One”.
*   This monster’s second effect cannot be used to Special Summon Fusion Monsters that can only be Summoned by Fusion Summon, such as “Dark Paladin”.

#### THE PUPPET MAGIC OF DARK RULER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Removing monsters on your side of the field from play is not a cost, so the opponent must decide if they want to chain before you select which monsters are to be removed. If they chain a card that negates the effect of "The Puppet Magic of Dark Ruler" you do not remove any monsters.
*   Face-down monsters may be removed from your side of the field.

#### THE REGULATION OF TRIBE

Netrep Rulings:

*   The Standby Phase payment of “The Regulation of Tribe” is optional.

#### THE SECRET OF THE BANDIT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card’s effect targets a monster, so you select the target at the activation of the card. You may select a face-down monster, or a monster on the opponent’s side of the field. If you target an opponent’s monster, and then take control of it with "Change of Heart" and attack and do Battle Damage to your opponent, he/she will discard a card. If you target an opponent’s monster, and attack that monster with a weaker monster, causing Battle Damage to yourself, no one will discard a card. The monster targeted by your "The Secret of the Bandit" must deal Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points for the effect to activate.
*   If the monster targeted by this card attacks directly and deals Battle Damage, this card’s effect will activate and the opponent must discard 1 card.
*   If you activate multiple copies of this card targeting the same monster, the opponent will still only discard 1 card when the monster deals Battle Damage.

#### THE SHALLOW GRAVE

Netrep Rulings:

*   Both players must have an eligible monster to Special Summon from the Graveyard to activate “The Shallow Grave.”
*   Both players must have an available Monster Zone to Special Summon a monster to activate “The Shallow Grave.”

#### THE SPELL ABSORBING LIFE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The "Spell Absorbing Life" is like "Ceasefire" except it gives you Life Points instead of damaging your opponent.
*   You can activate "The Spell Absorbing Life" as long as there is at least 1 face-down monster on the field, OR there is at least 1 effect monster on the field (or both).
*   If you control "Fire Princess" and activate "The Spell Absorbing Life", "Fire Princess" inflicts 500 damage no matter how many Life Points you gained from "The Spell Absorbing Life".

#### THE THING IN THE CRATER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can Special Summon a high-level Normal Monster with "The Thing in the Crater"'s effect, but not a "Special Summon-only" monster.

#### THE UNFRIENDLY AMAZON

*   You may Tribute one "The Unfriendly Amazon" to satisfy the maintenance cost of another "The Unfriendly Amazon".
*   "The Unfriendly Amazon" is NOT an Amazoness.

#### THE UNHAPPY GIRL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect only applies to "manual" changes. You can still change the monster's position with an effect.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" is in attack position and her controller uses "Waboku" or "Kuriboh" to take no damage from the attack, the attacking monster still cannot change battle position.
*   If "Tyrant Dragon" or "Hayabusa Knight" attacks "The Unhappy Girl" in attack position, they cannot attack again that turn.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" is flipped face-down and then flipped face-up again, then her effect is reset and any monsters that battled with her before can change their battle position and attack again.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" applies her effect to a monster, and "Skill Drain" is then activated and resolves, and "Skill Drain" is then destroyed afterwards, then "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect is re-applied and the monster that battled with her before "Skill Drain" was activated cannot attack or change battle position once again.
*   If your opponent attacks your "The Unhappy Girl" and you use "Magic Cylinder" to negate the attack, then "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect is not applied.
*   If you take control of your opponent's "The Unhappy Girl", her effect on your monsters from previous attacks is still applied.

#### THE WARRIOR RETURNING ALIVE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You may select a Warrior-Type Fusion Monster in your Graveyard, but it will be returned to the Fusion Deck instead of your hand.
*   You may select any Warrior-Type monster to return to your hand, regardless of its Summoning requirements. So you may select a "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" even if it was never properly Summoned.

#### THE WICKED WORM BEAST

Netrep Rulings:

*   “The Wicked Worm Beast” will not return to the player’s hand if it is not face up on the field during the End Phase.

#### THEBAN NIGHTMARE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you have only "Kuriboh" in your hand, and no Spell or Trap Cards on the field, and your "Theban Nightmare" battles with a card that has higher ATK/DEF, and you discard "Kuriboh", the ATK of "Theban Nightmare" is increased by 1500 AFTER damage calculation (but "Theban Nightmare" is still destroyed by damage calculation unless an effect like "Waboku" had been activated previously during the turn).

#### THEINEN THE GREAT SPHINX

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you Special Summon "Theinen the Great Sphinx" you do not have to pay the additional 500 Life Points to increase its ATK, you can choose to leave the ATK at 3500. If you do not pay the extra 500 when it is Summoned, you cannot later decide to pay and increase its ATK, it must be done when it is Special Summoned.
*   The effect of Summoning "Theinen the Great Sphinx" is a Trigger Effect, so you may do it during your opponent’s turn if "Andro Sphinx" and "Sphinx Teleia" are destroyed simultaneously.
*   Since Summoning "Theinen the Great Sphinx" is a Spell Speed 1 effect (Trigger Effect), you cannot chain multiple Special Summons of "Theinen the Great Sphinx" to one another. This means you can only Special Summon 1 copy of "Theinen the Great Sphinx" when the conditions are correct. You CANNOT pay 1000 Life Points to Special Summon 2 copies of this card.

#### THESTALOS THE FIRESTORM MONARCH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you Tribute Summon "Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch" successfully, and your opponent discards a monster like "Outstanding Dog Marron" or "Regenerating Mummy", you still inflict damage because the monster was discarded to the Graveyard (even though it doesn’t remain there).
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is face-up on the field, no damage is inflicted because the card is not discarded to the Graveyard.

GoatRulings.com:

*   If “Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch” is tribute summoned using “Sangan”, “Sangan” will be CL1 and Thestalos will be CL2. This is true even if the “Sangan” that was used as a tribute was the opponent’s through the effect of “Brain Control”, “Soul Exchange”, etc.

#### THOUSAND-EYES RESTRICT

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” may equip itself with one monster at a time per turn.

*   If two “Thousand Eyes-Restricts” are on the field, no monster may attack.

*   If a “Witch of the Black Forest” is equipped to “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” and sent to the Graveyard, the effect of “Witch of the Black Forest” will activate.

Judge List Rulings:

*   Face-down card equipped to "Relinquished"/"Thousand-Eyes Restrict" is a legal target for "Nobleman of Extermination." Curtis Schultz, 03/09/2005
*   Face-down card equipped to "Relinquished"/"Thousand-Eyes Restrict" will be returned to its owner's hand by "Byser Shock's" effect. Curtis Schultz, 03/09/2005

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If “Thousand Eyes Restrict” is Special Summoned and declares the activation of its effect on the opponent’s “Gemini Elf”, can the opponent activate “Ring of Destruction”?  
    A: The player controlling the "Ring of Destruction" could activate it when "Thousand Eyes Restrict" targets "Gemini Elf" with its effect. They could destroy the "Gemini Elf" in a chain. You could use "Ring of Destruction" and target the "Thousand Eyes Restrict" if you want to. You would use the same chain I demonstrated earlier, only the "Thousand Eyes Restrict" would be destroyed and would not be able to resolve its effect properly. Curtis Schultz, 02/18/2004
    

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

- Q: If I summon "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" and use its effect, what happens if my opponent chains a card that would flip-down or remove "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" from the field?  
A: For this example, say you declare the effect of "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" and your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to the effect. "Thousand-eyes Restrict" would be chain link 1 and "Book of Moon" would be chain link 2. In Yu-Gi-Oh! chains always resolve backwards. "Book of Moon" will resolve first, flipping down "Thousand-Eyes Restrict". "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" needs to be face up on the field to attach a monster to itself, so its effect will "fizzle" and the targeted monster will remain on the field. This applies to cards such as (but not limited to) "Book of Moon", "Ring of Destruction", and "Compulsory Evacuation Device".



#### THOUSAND ENERGY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you Summon a monster after the resolution of "Thousand Energy", it does not gain the +1000 ATK, but it is still destroyed during the End Phase because that effect is applied to all Level 2 Normal Monsters at that time.
*   If you have "A Legendary Ocean" reducing Level 3's to Level 2, and the effect of "Thousand Energy" is applied, and then "A Legendary Ocean" is destroyed, the levels are returned to Level 3, the ATK/DEF bonus from "Thousand Energy" is lost, and those monsters are not destroyed during the End Phase.
*   A monster affected by "Thousand Energy" is not destroyed if it is face-down during the End Phase.
*   If a monster affected by "Thousand Energy" switches control to your opponent, it is not destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If a monster affected by "Thousand Energy" has its Level changed so that it is not Level 2 during the End Phase, it is not destroyed.
*   If you use "Cost Down" to make a Level 4 monster into a Level 2 monster, Summon it, and use "Thousand Energy", during the End Phase you can choose which effect happens first, so you can restore it to Level 4 first by ending "Cost Down"'s effect, and then it will not be destroyed by the effect of "Thousand Energy".

#### THOUSAND KNIVES

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The required card only needs to be face-up on the field. It does not need to be a Monster Card, so if “Dark Magician” is equipped to your “Relinquished”, you can activate “Thousand Knives”.

#### THOUSAND NEEDLES

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When the DEF of "Thousand Needles" and the ATK of the attacking monster are the same, the attacking monster is not destroyed by "Thousand Needles"' effect.
*   If the attacking monster is destroyed, it is destroyed by "Thousand Needles"' effect, and it is sent to the Graveyard during the "send monsters to the Graveyard" portion of the Damage Step, at the same time a monster would normally be sent to the Graveyard because of damage calculation.

#### THREATENING ROAR

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate “Threatening Roar” in response to an attack, but the attack has already been declared so it will resolve normally. After that, your opponent cannot attack for the rest of the turn.
*   You cannot activate “Threatening Roar” during your own turn.

#### THROWSTONE UNIT

Netrep Rulings:

*   The player activating “Thunder Crash” must control at least one monster.

#### THUNDER DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can discard "Thunder Dragon" to activate its effect even if it would not go to your Graveyard. For example, when "Banisher of the Light" is face-up on the field.
*   If you have your opponent's "Thunder Dragon" in your hand because of "Exchange", you can discard it to activate its effect and search your Deck for up to 2 "Thunder Dragons".
*   You can discard "Thunder Dragon" to activate its effect even if you have 2 "Thunder Dragon" already in your Graveyard.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Thunder Dragon’s” effect is an activated effect.
*   “Thunder Dragon” may be discarded to search for 0 “Thunder Dragons” in the player’s deck.
*   The effect of “Thunder Dragon” may not be activated if it is discarded through another effect.

#### THUNDER NYAN NYAN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You may Summon "Thunder Nyan Nyan" even if you have non-LIGHT monsters on the field, but she will be destroyed.
*   You can have face-down non-LIGHT monsters on your side of the field, "Thunder Nyan Nyan" will not be destroyed by her own effect, but if one of these monsters is flipped face-up, she will be destroyed.
*   When you take control of an opponent’s non-LIGHT monster, and you have "Thunder Nyan Nyan" on the field, she will be destroyed. If your opponent takes control of your "Thunder Nyan Nyan" and he / she controls a non-LIGHT monster, "Thunder Nyan Nyan" will be destroyed.
*   You can Special Summon "Thunder Nyan Nyan" with the effect of "Cyber Jar" but if you Summon another non-LIGHT monster face-up she will be destroyed.
*   "Thunder Nyan Nyan" can be destroyed by her own effect between steps in a chain. For example, the opponent targets your "Thunder Nyan Nyan" with "Snatch Steal". You chain "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Dark Magician" from your Graveyard, a DARK monster. The chain resolves as follows: "Call of the Haunted" resolves, "Thunder Nyan Nyan" is destroyed because there is a DARK monster on the field, "Snatch Steal"’s effect disappears because the target is no longer on the field.
*   If you have a face-up "Thunder Nyan Nyan" and your Set "Penguin Soldier" is attacked, when it is flipped face-up "Thunder Nyan Nyan" will be destroyed, before it can be targeted by the effect of "Penguin Soldier".

#### THUNDER OF RULER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you activate "Thunder of Ruler", since your opponent cannot enter the Battle Phase, your opponent proceeds from Main Phase 1 to the End Phase.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If Main Phase 1 is also skipped after the effect of “Thunder of Ruler,” the affected player will not receive a Main Phase 2.

#### TIME SEAL

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of “Time Seal” skips the Draw Phase of the opponent immediately following “Time Seal’s” activation.

#### TIME WIZARD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of "Time Wizard" is a Ignition Effect, and therefore can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of “Time Wizard” is non-targeting.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If I call “Time Wizard's” Coin Flip wrong, can I use “Barrel Behind the Door” to give the damage to my opponent, even though my monsters are still destroyed?  
    A: In a nutshell, you must use "Barrel Behind the Door" in response to an effect that you KNOW will inflict damage to your Life Points (which is why you can't use it in response to "Dice Jar"). Also, "Time Wizard" causes you to "lose" Life Points. Since "Barrel Behind the Door" cannot be used against such effects, you cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door" with "Time Wizard" anyway. Steve Okegawa, 01/08/2004

#### TIMEATER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your Main Phase 1 is skipped because of "Timeater", you can enter your Battle Phase (even if you have no monsters on the field) and proceed from there to Main Phase 2. If you cannot enter your Battle Phase (due to another card effect such as "Great Long Nose" or "Frozen Soul"), then you must go immediately from Standby Phase to End Phase.
*   If your "Timeater" and your opponent’s monster destroy each other as a result of battle, the effect of "Timeater" is still activated.

#### TIMIDITY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While the effect of "Timidity" is active, all effects of a card which would destroy a Set Spell or Trap Card are negated.
*   While the effect of "Timidity" is active, you cannot destroy a face-down Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished".
*   While the effect of "Timidity" is active, and your opponent activates "Heavy Storm", face-down Spell and Trap Cards are not destroyed but face-up cards will be.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of “Timidity” applies until the beginning of the opponent’s End Phase.

#### TOKEN THANKSGIVING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Token Thanksgiving" will destroy a Monster Token equipped to "Relinquished".

#### TOLL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Paying Life Points for "Toll" is a cost, so if a player cannot pay the 500 Life Points, they cannot declare an attack. If there are two of this card on the field, a player must pay 1000 Life Points per monster to attack.

#### TOON GEMINI ELF

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You do not have to have "Toon World" on the field to Summon or Set "Toon Gemini Elf", or to attack with it.
*   The Summon of "Toon Gemini Elf" is a Normal Summon, not a Special Summon (even if you have "Toon World" on the field). So you can Normal Summon it in face-up Attack Position, or Set it in face-down Defense Position.
*   You don't pay Life Points to attack with "Toon Gemini Elf". If your opponent has a Toon Monster on the field, "Toon Gemini Elf" does not have to attack it. However, it will prevent "Toon Gemini Elf" from being able to attack directly.
*   "Toon Gemini Elf" can attack directly, but only while "Toon World" is on your side of the field. (Unlike previous Toon Monsters, which can attack directly even without "Toon World".)

#### TOON MONSTERS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This rule applies for "Toon Mermaid", "Toon Summoned Skull", "Manga Ryu-Ran" and "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon": If "Toon World" is returned to a player’s hand, with cards such as "Giant Trunade" these Toon Monsters are not destroyed since "Toon World" was not destroyed.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Toon monsters may not attack the turn they are Special Summoned, regardless of how they are Special Summoned.
*   If both players have “Toon World” on the field, if one “Toon World” is destroyed, all Toon monsters are destroyed.
*   If “Toon World” is sent to the Graveyard, but not destroyed, Toon monsters are not destroyed.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If both players have “Toon World” and Toon Monsters on their side of the field and the opponent’s “Toon World” is destroyed, would all Toon Monsters be destroyed or only the opponent’s Toon Monsters?  
    A: Both player's Toon monsters would be destroyed when a "Toon World" is destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 02/01/2004
*   Q: If a face-down “Toon World” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, are Toon Monsters on the field also destroyed?  
    A: All face-up Toon monsters would be destroyed because "Toon World" was destroyed. It does not matter if "Toon World" was face-up or face-down when it was destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 02/22/2004
*   Q: Can Sheep Tokens be used as Tributes for Toon Monsters?  
    A: Yes. bishop 02/21/2004

#### TOON MERMAID

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Toon Mermaid” is turned face-down by an effect, it may not be Flip Summoned unless “Toon World” is face up on the summoning player’s field.
*   If either player’s “Toon World” is destroyed while “Toon Mermaid” is face-up and active on the field, “Toon Mermaid” is destroyed.
*   “Toon Mermaid” may be Special Summoned from the Graveyard if it has been Special Summoned properly once and the summoning player has “Toon World” on his or her field.
*   “Toon Mermaid” may not attack the same turn it is Special Summoned, regardless of how it was Special Summoned.

#### TOON SUMMONED SKULL

Netrep Rulings:

*   One monster must be Tributed to Special Summon “Toon Summoned Skull” while “Toon World” is face up on the summoning player’s field.
*   If “Toon Summoned Skull” is turned face-down by an effect, it may not be Flip Summoned unless “Toon World” is face up on the summoning player’s field.
*   If either player’s “Toon World” is destroyed while “Toon Summoned Skull” is face-up and active on the field, “Toon Summoned Skull” is destroyed.
*   “Toon Summoned Skull” may be Special Summoned from the Graveyard if it has been Special Summoned properly once and the summoning player has “Toon World” on his or her field.
*   “Toon Summoned Skull” may not attack the same turn it is Special Summoned, regardless of how it was Special Summoned.

#### TOON WORLD

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The 1000 Life Points needs to only be paid once when this card is activated. Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.

#### TORNADO WALL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Tornado Wall" may be Set on the field if "Umi" is not on the field, but it cannot be activated. If targeted by "Bait Doll" when face-down and "Umi" is not on the field, it is destroyed.
*   "Tornado Wall" may be activated when "Maiden of the Aqua" or "A Legendary Ocean" is face-up on the field.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If a player attacks “Amazoness Swords Woman” with a monster with higher ATK, the damage redirected by “Amazoness Swords Woman” will be reduced to 0 by “Tornado Wall.”
*   “Tornado Wall” is unaffected by “Imperial Order” negating the effect of “Umi.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does the errata on “Tornado Wall” mean that you are no longer protected from overflow damage from your own attacks?  
    A: That is correct. Your Life Points would only be protected from the Life Point damage that would result from an opponent's monster that is attacking you. So if your "Gemini Elf" attacks your opponent's Defense Position "Giant Soldier of Stone," you will still lose 100 Life Points. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004

  

#### TORRENTIAL TRIBUTE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Torrential Tribute" is activated after a monster is Summoned; it is not chained to the Summon. So you cannot activate "Torrential Tribute" when "Jinzo" is Summoned.
*   "Torrential Tribute" can be activated after a monster is Summoned through another card’s effect, such as "Monster Reborn", "Scapegoat", "Cyber Jar" (if Flip Summoned), or "Call of the Haunted".
*   "Torrential Tribute" can be activated after a Flip Summon, but it does not negate the Flip Effect (it is chained to the Flip Effect).
*   "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated during the Damage Step. This prohibits "Torrential Tribute" from being used against monsters Special Summoned by "Mystic Tomato", "Giant Rat", "Nimble Momonga", "Masked Dragon", and other such cards that Special Summon a monster when destroyed as a result of battle, as well as "Cyber Jar" or "Morphing Jar #2" that is flipped face-up by an attack.

#### TOTAL DEFENSE SHOGUN

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Total Defense Shogun" does not permanently remain in Defense Position. After the turn that "Total Defense Shogun" is Summoned, you can change his battle position as normal. He can also have his battle position changed with card effects like "Stop Defense".
*   You don’t Normal Summon or Flip Summon "Total Defense Shogun" in Defense Position; you Normal Summon or Flip Summon him in face-up Attack Position and he changes to Defense Position. (Or you can Tribute Set him in face-down Defense Position.)
*   You cannot chain to "Total Defense Shogun"’s effect that changes him to Defense Position when Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned. So you cannot chain "Spellbinding Circle", etc.
*   Do not change "Total Defense Shogun" automatically to Defense Position if he is Special Summoned, only if he is Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned.
*   While "Total Defense Shogun" is in Defense Position, he attacks using his ATK but defends with his DEF if he is attacked. If he attacks a monster with higher ATK, but ATK lower than "Total Defense Shogun"’s DEF, "Total Defense Shogun" is still destroyed because the battle is ATK vs. ATK.
*   "Widespread Ruin" and "Mirror Force" cannot destroy "Total Defense Shogun" if he attacks while in Defense Position, and his attack resolves as normal.
*   If "Total Defense Shogun" in Defense Position is your only monster, and attacks, your opponent cannot activate "Mirror Force" because it will have no effect.
*   If "Total Defense Shogun" attacks while in Attack Position, and is changed to Defense Position by "Windstorm of Etaqua", his attack resolves as normal because he can attack while in Defense Position.
*   If "Total Defense Shogun" is a Dragon-Type because of "D. Tribe" or "DNA Surgery", and "Dragon Capture Jar" is in play, "Total Defense Shogun" can still attack.
*   If you select "Total Defense Shogun" with "Dark Spirit of the Silent", "Total Defense Shogun" changes to Attack Position even though he could attack while in Defense Position.

#### TOWER OF BABEL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You place Spell Counters on "Tower of Babel" after the Spell Card resolves.
*   "Tower of Babel" must be active and face-up on the field before the Spell Card was activated, and when the Spell Card resolves, in order to get a Spell Counter. If you chain "Tower of Babel" to a Spell Card, you do not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card. If a Quick-Play Spell Card is chained to the activation of "Tower of Babel", you do not get a Spell Counter for that Quick-Play Spell Card.
*   You can move Spell Counters to "Tower of Babel" with "Pitch Black Power Stone", but if the 4th Spell Counter is placed on "Tower of Babel" with "Pitch Black Power Stone" or "Apprentice Magician", "Tower of Babel" is destroyed but no damage is inflicted.
*   "Tower of Babel" cannot blow up in the middle of a chain. If you wind up with 5 Spell Counters on "Tower of Babel" after a chain resolves, the player who caused the 4th Spell Counter to be placed takes the damage. So if you have "Tower of Babel" with 3 Spell Counters, and you activate "Pot of Greed", and your opponent chains "Reload", "Reload" resolves first and places the 4th Spell Counter, and your opponent takes the 3000 damage after the current chain resolves.
*   If "Mystical Space Typhoon" targets "Tower of Babel" with 3 Spell Counters, "Tower of Babel" is destroyed when "Mystical Space Typhoon" resolves, and never gets the 4th Spell Counter, so neither player takes damage.

#### TRAGEDY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Tragedy" during the Damage Step.
*   You can activate "Tragedy" after an Attack Position monster is changed to Defense Position by a card effect, such as "Enemy Controller" or "Stumbling".
*   "Spear Dragon" changes its battle position at the end of the Damage Step, so you cannot activate "Tragedy" at that time. "Goblin Attack Force" and "Giant Orc" change their battle positions at the end of the Battle Phase, so you can activate "Tragedy" at that time.

#### TRANSCENDENT WING

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can send a face-down “Winged Kuriboh” to the Graveyard to activate the effect of “Transcendent Wings”.
*   You can activate “Transcendent Wings” even if there is no “Winged Kuriboh LV10” in your hand or Deck, but you must show your Deck to the opponent if they want to confirm.

#### TRAP DUSTSHOOT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can select your own card that was taken by your opponent with "Exchange". The card returns to the owner's deck (yours, in this case).

GoatRulings.com Rulings:

*   Q: If I activate "Trap Dustshoot" when my opponent has 4 or more cards in their hand, but an effect is activated (such as chaining “Book of Moon” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”) after "Trap Dustshoot" is activated that causes them to have less than 4 cards in their hand, do I still get to see my opponent’s hand and return a monster?  
    A: Yes. If a player has 4 cards in hand when “Trap Dustshoot” is activated and they chain a card causing them to go below the 4 card requirement you will still get the effect of “Trap Dustshoot.” For the player to successfully dodge “Trap Dustshoot” they would need to use their turn player priority to use “Book of Moon” or “Mystical Space Typhoon” BEFORE you activate “Trap Dustshoot”..

#### TRAP HOLE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Trap Hole” is a targeting effect.

#### TRAP JAMMER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can activate "Trap Jammer" during the Damage Step.

#### TRAP MASTER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   This card can destroy a Trap Card on either side of the field. So if your opponent has no Trap Cards and no Set Spell or Trap Cards, you must destroy a card on your side of the field. If it is face-down Spell Card you must reveal it to your opponent, and it is not destroyed.

#### TRAP OF BOARD ERASER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate this card when your opponent does not have a hand.
*   For other rulings, see "Barrel Behind the Door".

#### TRIANGLE ECSTASY SPARK

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Triangle Ecstasy Spark" if "Harpie Lady Sisters" is not on the field. You can activate it if the opponent controls a "Harpie Lady Sisters". In that case the ATK of the opponent’s "Harpie Lady Sisters" will become 2700, but the opponent still cannot activate Trap Cards, and the effects of Trap Cards on the opponent’s side of the field are negated.
*   If there are multiple copies of "Harpie Lady Sisters" on the field, the ATK of each becomes 2700 until the End Phase.
*   If a Trap Card such as "Waboku" is chained to the activation of "Triangle Ecstasy Spark", the effect of "Waboku" resolves first, and will apply for the rest of the turn regardless of "Triangle Ecstasy Spark". (Just like if "Jinzo" is Summoned after "Waboku" is activated and resolves.)

#### TRIBE-INFECTING VIRUS

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You declare the Type when you activate the effect and discard for the cost, not when the effect resolves, so your opponent can chain after you have announced which Type will be destroyed.
*   You CAN declare a Type that exists only on your opponent's side of the field. You CANNOT declare a Type that is not face-up on the field at all.
*   You can use this effect repeatedly as long as you can keep paying the cost.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Player A activates the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus” and declares one Type. Player B chains the effect with “DNA Surgery” declaring a different Type. Will the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus” resolve with no effect since the Type of all monsters has changed?  
    A: Correct. The Type declared when "Tribe-Infecting Virus'" effect was activated no longer exists on the field due to "DNA Surgery," so its effect will disappear. The monster would not be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/12/2004

#### TRIBUTE DOLL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot use "Tribute Doll" to Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster like "Dark Necrofear".
*   You can use Monster Tokens as a cost for "Tribute Doll".
*   If you Special Summon a monster with "Tribute Doll", you cannot activate "Diffusion Wave-Motion" on that monster because it cannot attack that turn due to "Tribute Doll"'s effect. However, you can use "Diffusion Wave-Motion" on the monster during your next turn.
*   You can combine "Soul Exchange" with "Tribute Doll" to Tribute your opponent's monster as the cost of "Tribute Doll".

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Tribute Doll” is not a targeting effect.
*   If the monster Special Summoned by “Tribute Doll” is sent to the Graveyard and Special Summoned in the same turn, that monster may attack.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If Player A takes control of Player B’s monster with “Change of Heart” and activates “Tribute Doll” which Player B chains “Imperial Order” to, what happens to Player B’s monster?  
    A: Player B's monster would be Tributed when you activate "Tribute Doll." This is assuming Player B allowed the "Change of Heart" to resolve, which it sounds like they did. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004

#### TROOP DRAGON

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: When the third "Troop Dragon" is destroyed, is your opponent allowed to inspect your deck to verify that you do not have another "Troop Dragon" to Special Summon?  
    A: Yes they can. It should not take long to do this. The Deck would need to be shuffled afterwards, naturally. Curtis Schultz, 02/01/2004

#### TSUKUYOMI

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You can select "Tsukuyomi" itself as the target of "Tsukuyomi"'s effect, but not when "Tsukuyomi" was flipped face-up by an attack and destroyed by damage calculation.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Tsukuyomi’s” effect is mandatory.

#### TUTAN MASK

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You cannot activate "Tutan Mask" to negate a Spell or Trap Card that targets a Zombie-Type monster in the Graveyard or Deck (such as "Monster Reborn").
*   You cannot use "Tutan Mask" to negate a Spell or Trap Card that targets a face-down Zombie-Type monster.

#### TWIN SWORDS OF FLASHING LIGHT - TRYCE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Sending a card to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   If the first attack of a monster equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" is negated by "Magic Cylinder", the monster can still perform the second attack.
*   When you declare the second attack of a monster equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", and the "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" is destroyed during the Battle Step with "Mystical Space Typhoon", the monster is no longer capable of performing the second attack, and a replay occurs.
*   If a monster that normally attacks twice like "Hayabusa Knight", "Gray Wing", or "Tyrant Dragon" is equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", it doesn't get a third attack.
*   You can equip "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" to "Injection Fairy Lily" and you can use her effect for each attack.
*   If "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" is equipped to a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion", it can only attack twice.
*   If "Dark Blade" equipped with "Kiryu" is also equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", and attacks twice, and "Kiryu" is then "detached" with "Combination Attack", "Dark Blade" can attack 1 more time (not 2 more times).
*   If "Airknight Parshath" is equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" and attacks twice, you can draw twice.

Netrep Rulings:

*   Multiple copies of “Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce” do not increase the number of attacks a monster may perform.
*   If “Giant Orc” is equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce”, it may attack twice as per the effect of “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce” and will be changed to Defense position at the end of the Battle Phase as per the effect of “Giant Orc.”
*   If “Goblin Attack Force” is equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce”, it may attack twice as per the effect of “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce” and will be changed to Defense position at the end of the Battle Phase as per the effect of “Goblin Attack Force.”
*   If “Spear Dragon” is equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce,” “Spear Dragon” will still be changed to Defense position at the resolution of its fi rst attack, as per the effect of “Spear Dragon.

#### TWIN-HEADED BEHEMOTH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The effect of this card is only activated when it is "destroyed". It will not activate if Tributed, discarded, or sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is Special Summoned by its own effect you can activate "Card of Safe Return" and draw 1 card.
*   When "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is Special Summoned by its own effect and is equipped with "Megamorph" it is the original ATK/DEF that is doubled or halved. (ATK 3000 / DEF 2400 if doubled, ATK 750 / DEF 600 if halved)
*   The opponent cannot activate "Bottomless Trap Hole" when "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is Special Summoned by its own effect, because its ATK is already changed to 1000 at the time of Summoning.
*   The condition that this card’s effect can only be used once per Duel cannot be reset. So if it is Special Summoned by its own effect and later removed from play, flipped face-down, returned to your hand, destroyed and Special Summoned, or shuffled into your Deck, you STILL cannot use its effect a second time.
*   If removed from play temporarily by the effect of "Dimensionhole" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", it will return with its original ATK/DEF, but its condition is not reset.
*   If flipped face-down, and then Flip Summoned, it will have its original ATK/DEF, but its condition is not reset.
*   If equipped to "Relinquished" and destroyed, you can use the effect of this card and it will be Special Summoned on your side of the field with ATK/DEF of 1000 points. (If you have not already used this effect once.)
*   If this card is controlled by your opponent and is destroyed, it will be Special Summoned on your side of the field with ATK/DEF of 1000 points. (If you have not already used this effect once.)
*   If "Twin-Headed Behemoth" would be Special Summoned by its own effect, but your Monster Card Zones are full, or the effect of "Scapegoat" prevents you from Summoning, it still considered that its effect was activated, and you cannot use it again in the current Duel.
*   You may still Special Summon "Twin-Headed Behemoth" with the effect of "Monster Reborn", etc. after its effect has been used once.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon "Twin-Headed Behemoth" in the turn it was destroyed, its effect has not yet been used, and it will activate the next time it is destroyed.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Twin-Headed Behemoth’s” effect only trigger when it is destroyed on the field?  
    A: Normally this happens while it is on the field, but if a card effect was to destroy it while it was in your hand or Deck and then send it to the Graveyard, the effect would be satisfied. Say, if I had my opponent's "Twin-Headed Behemoth" in my hand from the effect of "Exchange." I Summon it and my opponent activates "Chain Destruction." "Chain Destruction" could destroy the copy in my Deck and send it to the Graveyard. ("Chain Destruction" includes the text of destroying the affected cards in the player's hand and/or Deck) This is most likely never going to happen though, so I wouldn't count on it. For the most part, the "Twin-Headed Behemoth" will be destroyed while it is on the field. Curtis Schultz, 02/02/2004

#### TWO THOUSAND NEEDLES

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You destroy the attacking monster with "Two Thousand Needles"' effect at the end of the Damage Step.

Netrep Rulings:

#### TYPE ZERO MAGIC CRUSHER

Netrep Rulings:

*   Type Zero Magic Crusher’s” effect is an activated effect.
*   Spell Cards discarded for another purpose may not be used for the effect of “Type Zero Magic Crusher.”

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Can a player use the effect of “Type Zero Magic Crusher” during the opponent’s turn?  
    A: Yes they can activate the effect of "Type Zero Magic Crusher" during the opponent's turn. Curtis Schultz, 01/31/2004

#### TYRANNO INFINITY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The ATK of “Tyranno Infinity” changes according to the current number of your Dinosaur removed from play.
*   Remember that monsters removed from play go to the “removed zone” of the owner, even if controlled by the opponent, and even if they will return to the opponent’s side of the field later because of “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”.
*   If “Tyranno Infinity” is equipped with “Megamorph” and the number of removed from play Dinosaurs changes, first change the original ATK of “Tyranno Infinity”, and then double or halve for “Megamorph”.

#### TYRANT DRAGON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The first sentence of this card’s text means that after you complete an attack with "Tyrant Dragon", if there is still a monster on the opponent’s side of the field, "Tyrant Dragon" can immediately attack again. You cannot attack with another monster in between, and then attack a second time with "Tyrant Dragon." If there are no monsters on your opponent’s side of the field after "Tyrant Dragon"’s first attack, "Tyrant Dragon" does not gain a second attack.
*   "Tyrant Dragon" cannot attack more than twice, even if there is another monster remaining on your opponent’s side of the field after the second attack.
*   "Tyrant Dragon"’s first attack does not have to be the first attack of the Battle Phase. You may attack with another monster, then with "Tyrant Dragon", then again with "Tyrant Dragon" -- if the opponent still controls a monster.
*   Suppose you control "Tyrant Dragon" and another monster ("Dark Magician" for example), and the opponent only has 1 monster. You attack with "Tyrant Dragon" and destroy their 1 monster. Then you declare a direct attack with "Dark Magician" and the opponent activates "Scapegoat" to Special Summon 4 "Sheep Tokens". A replay occurs, and that means "Tyrant Dragon" was the last monster to attack, so it may attack again, and attack one of the Sheep Tokens. Then you can attack with "Dark Magician".
*   The opponent may activate Trap Cards that target "Tyrant Dragon", but their effects will be negated and the cards destroyed.
*   When you Summon "Tyrant Dragon", the opponent can activate "Torrential Tribute" or "Bottomless Trap Hole" and destroy "Tyrant Dragon" because neither of these Trap Cards target. (However, "Trap Hole" does target and its effect will disappear if activated.)
*   When you attack with "Tyrant Dragon" the opponent can activate "Mirror Force" and all your Attack Position monsters, including "Tyrant Dragon", will be destroyed. This is because "Mirror Force" does not target.
*   You may activate "Last Turn" and select your "Tyrant Dragon" as the monster to keep, because "Last Turn" does not target.
*   When you Summon "Tyrant Dragon" the opponent can activate "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven" to negate the Summon.
*   You can activate "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon". After it resolves, "Call of the Haunted" will be destroyed and "Tyrant Dragon" will remain on the field. You must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster to perform this Special Summon, in accordance with the text of "Tyrant Dragon".
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon your opponent’s "Tyrant Dragon" in your opponent’s Graveyard, you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster from your side of the field. If you do not control a Dragon-Type monster, you cannot select "Tyrant Dragon" as a target for "Monster Reborn".
*   You Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when the effect that Special Summons "Tyrant Dragon" resolves, not when it activates. So if you activate "Monster Reborn" and target "Tyrant Dragon" and your opponent chains "Imperial Order" and negates "Monster Reborn" you do not Tribute a Dragon-Type monster. Likewise, if you control 1 Dragon-Type monster on the field, and activate "Monster Reborn", and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy your only Dragon-Type monster, you are unable to Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when "Monster Reborn" resolves and its effect disappears.
*   You may Tribute a face-down Dragon-Type monster when you Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon".
*   Even if "Tyrant Dragon" was destroyed by "Dark Balter the Terrible" or some other monster that negated the effect of "Tyrant Dragon", you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster if you Special Summon it because this is a condition, not an effect.

#### WABOKU

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Waboku" makes Battle Damage dealt by your opponent's monsters to your monsters and to your Life Points become zero.
*   "Waboku" applies to ALL of the monsters on that player's side of the field for the entire turn.
*   To illustrate how "Waboku" works, here are some scenarios and their results:
*   SCENARIO 1: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball", and Player B activates "Waboku". RESULT: Player A's (attacking) "Mega Thunderball" is destroyed. Player B's "Mega Thunderball" (with equal ATK) is NOT destroyed.
*   SCENARIO 2: Player A activates "Waboku". Player A's "Mega Thunderball" then attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball". RESULT: Player B's "Mega Thunderball" is destroyed. Player A's (attacking) "Mega Thunderball" is NOT destroyed. So you can use "Waboku" "offensively" when attacking an equal ATK monster.
*   SCENARIO 3: Player A activates "Waboku". Player A's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" then attacks Player B's "Sanga of the Thunder". Player B uses "Sanga of the Thunder"'s effect (during the Damage Step). RESULT: Player A's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (ATK 0) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any Life Points, because of Player A's "Waboku".
*   SCENARIO 4: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball". Player B activates "Fairy Box" or "Mirror Wall". Player A activates "Waboku". RESULT: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" (with reduced ATK) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any life points, because of Player A's "Waboku". But because Player A's "Mega Thunderball" had reduced ATK, Player B's "Mega Thunderball" is not destroyed either.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Waboku” may not be activated in the Damage Step.
*   “Waboku” lasts for the turn it was activated in.
*   “Waboku’s” effect applies to all monsters on the side of the field of the player who activated “Waboku.”
*   “Waboku” only changes the battle damage of a monster inflicts to the controller of “Waboku” to 0.
*   “Waboku” does not alter ATK value.
*   If a monster protected by “Waboku” is attacked by or attacks a monster with the same ATK value that is not protected by “Waboku,” the other monster is destroyed in battle as normal.
*   Face-down monsters attacked while protected by “Waboku” will still flip face up.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Player A declares an attack with a monster that has an equal ATK as the opponent’s monster. Player B activates “Waboku.” Player A chains with “Waboku.” What happens to the two monsters?  
    A: Neither monster would be destroyed by the attack. Curtis Schultz, 01/14/2004
*   Q: If “Waboku” has been activated, will the damage from “Rod of the Mind’s Eye” or “Dark Scorpion Combination” be applied or will it also be reduced to 0?  
    A: The Battle Damage will still be reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku." Curtis Schultz, 02/18/2004

#### WALL OF ILLUSION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the monster battling with "Wall of Illusion" is somehow destroyed during Damage Calculation, it is sent to the Graveyard and NOT returned to the owner’s hand.

Netrep Rulings:

*   The effect of “Wall of Illusion” does not activate if it attacks another monster.
*   The effect of “Wall of Illusion” resolves in the "Resolve Effects" stage of the Damage Step.
*   The effect of “Wall of Illusion” is not targeting.
*   If “Dark Ruler Ha Des” destroys “Wall of Illusion,” that “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is not returned to the owner’s hand.

#### WALL OF REVEALING LIGHT

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Paying Life Points for "Wall of Revealing Light" is a cost.
*   If "Wall of Revealing Light"'s effect is negated by "Royal Decree" or "Jinzo", and then that card is destroyed, the effect of "Wall of Revealing Light" is re-applied.
*   The monsters prevented from attacking by "Wall of Revealing Light"'s effect cannot even "declare" an attack.
*   You can chain "Last Turn" to your activation of "Wall of Revealing Light" as long as "Last Turn"'s conditions are then correct (1000 or less Life Points).
*   You can activate "Wall of Revealing Light" during the Battle Step after an attack has been declared. If the monster's ATK is lower than the Life Points you paid, the attack stops (does not enter the Damage Step).

#### WATAPON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If you draw "Watapon" by the effect of "Graceful Charity" you can Special Summon it to the field after you discard the two cards for "Graceful Charity".
*   "Painful Choice", "Graceful Charity", and "Witch of the Black Forest" are all examples of the types of effects that will activate the effect of "Watapon".

#### WAVE-MOTION CANNON

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard is a cost, so when you send it to the Graveyard, it's too late for your opponent to chain "Mystical Space Typhoon", etc., to destroy "Wave-Motion Cannon", because "Wave-Motion Cannon" is already in the Graveyard.
*   Your opponent cannot chain "Magic Jammer", or use "Dark Paladin", etc., when you send "Wave-Motion Cannon" from the field to the Graveyard. Your opponent CAN chain "Magic Jammer" or use "Dark Paladin", etc., when you first activate "Wave-Motion Cannon" (meaning when you place it face-up on the field).
*   If "Imperial Order" is active on the field, count Standby Phases as normal for "Wave-Motion Cannon".
*   You can activate "Wave-Motion Cannon" (place it face-up on the field) and send it to the Graveyard during the same turn, but it will not do any damage.
*   If the Standby Phase is skipped with "Solomon's Lawbook" or the turn is skipped with "Gamble", increase the count for "Wave-Motion Cannon" anyway.
*   You cannot use "Pyro Clock of Destiny" with "Wave-Motion Cannon".

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Wave-Motion Cannon” counts the number of Standby Phases it was on the field when it is sent to the Graveyard by its effect.
*   If “Imperial Order” is active when “Wave Motion Cannon” sends itself to the Graveyard, the effect of “Wave-Motion Cannon” is negated and no damage is inflicted.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: During Main Phase 1, can “Wave-Motion Cannon” be sent to the Graveyard for its effect prior to the opponent attempting to destroy it with a Set “Mystical Space Typhoon”?  
    A: As the turn player you could claim priority and send the "Wave Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard, to which the opponent can then respond. This would not be true if you were to activate another card's effect during your Main Phase 1 first, like "Raigeki" for example, since they could then respond with their "Mystical Space Typhoon" in a chain to "Raigeki" and destroy the "Wave Motion Cannon" in the chain. The opponent would need to destroy your "Wave Motion Cannon" during your Standby Phase. Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004
*   Q: If a “Wave-Motion Cannon” is on my field and I activate “Imperial Order” does it still get its counter during my Standby phase.  
    A: “Wave-Motion Cannon” does not use Counters. If “Imperial Order” is on the field, “Wave-Motion Cannon” will still get its phase count, but it does not use physical counters like other spell cards do. bishop, 12/07/2003
*   Q: If “Imperial Order” were active after “Wave-Motion Cannon” was activated, when “Imperial Order” leaves play, does the turn count return to 0?  
    A: No, its count starts when it enters play and leaves when it leaves play. bishop 01/05/2004

#### WEAPON CHANGE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Weapon Change" applies to the current ATK & DEF.
*   "Weapon Change"'s effect targets 1 monster. You select the monster when you activate "Weapon Change"'s effect.
*   If you use "Weapon Change"'s effect on "Freed the Matchless General", "Weapon Change" is destroyed.
*   Even if the selected monster's Type is changed by "DNA Surgery", the monster receives the effect of "Weapon Change".
*   If "Weapon Change" is removed from the field by "Giant Trunade" or "Emergency Provisions", "Weapon Change"'s effect is not applied.
*   If "Imperial Order" is activated after "Weapon Change", "Weapon Change"'s effect is negated, but if "Imperial Order" is destroyed, then "Weapon Change"'s effect is re-applied.
*   If you switch a monster's ATK/DEF with "Weapon Change", and then apply a new modifier, apply it to the switched ATK/DEF. Then, after "Weapon Change"'s effect ceases, re-apply the modifier to the reverted ATK/DEF once again.
*   If you use "Weapon Change" to make "Gear Golem" into a 2200/800 monster, then use "Limiter Removal" to make it 4400/800, then destroy "Weapon Change", "Gear Golem" is 800/4400.

#### WHITE MAGICIAN PIKERU

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Monster tokens and face-down monsters are included for "White Magician Pikeru"'s effect.
*   Even if there are many monsters, "White Magician Pikeru" increases Life Points by 1 lump sum.
*   "White Magician Pikeru" includes itself in its effect.
*   If you resolve "White Magician Pikeru"'s effect and then in the same Standby Phase the number of monsters on the field increases, you don't get additional Life Points.

#### WICKED-BREAKING FLAMBERGE - BAOU

Individual Card FAQs:

*   Sending 1 card to the Graveyard is a cost. This is not "discarding" so it doesn't trigger "Forced Requisition", and you can pay the cost even if "Goblin of Greed" is in play.
*   If a monster equipped with "Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou" attacks and destroys "Amazoness Fighter" or "Amazoness Swordswoman", their effects are not negated because they happen during damage calculation, before they are determined to have been destroyed.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Wicked-Breaking Flamberge – Baou” permanently disable monster effects such as “Sinister Serpent?” Or are there some kind of limits as to how long its effect lasts on the monster?  
    A: It would work just like the effect of "Dark Ruler Ha Des." Curtis Schultz, 01/14/2004
*   Q: Does "Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou" negate Flip Effects of destroyed monsters, or just “Sangan”, “Mystic Tomato”, and “Dark Necrofear” type cards?  
    A: A monster equipped with "Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou" will negate the effect of any monster it destroys. This includes Flip Effect monsters, because Flip Effects are not applied until AFTER damage calculation (at which point a monster has already been determined to either remain on the field or be destroyed from battle). Steve Okegawa, 02/22/2004

#### WIDESPREAD RUIN

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Widespread Ruin” is a non-targeting effect.
*   The effect of “Widespread Ruin” does not negate the attack.

#### WILD NATURE'S RELEASE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   When you increase the ATK of a monster with "Wild Nature's Release", then apply another modifier, the new modifier is applied to the current ATK points.
*   If "Ojama Yellow" is equipped with "Axe of Despair" (1000 ATK, 1000 DEF), if "Wild Nature's Release" is activated then it increases "Ojama Yellow" to 2000 ATK, 1000 DEF. If "Axe of Despair" is then destroyed, "Ojama Yellow" remains 2000 ATK, 1000 DEF.
*   If a monster is affected by "Wild Nature's Release", and its Type is then changed with "DNA Surgery", the effect of "Wild Nature's Release" is not negated and the monster is still destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If you activate multiple "Wild Nature's Releases", the effects are cumulative.

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Wild Nature’s Release” increases the ATK of one Beast-Type or Beast-Warrior-Type by its current DEF at the time this card is activated.
*   The monster that is the target of “Wild Nature’s Release” is not destroyed and returns to its original ATK and DEF if flipped face-down, removed from the field or sent back to the Hand.

#### WINGED KURIBOH

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed as a result of battle, its effect will not reduce the Battle Damage its owner takes from that battle, because its effect doesn’t activate until later, when it’s sent to the Graveyard. (And damage calculation has already happened by then.)
*   If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates and applies for the rest of the turn, even if “Winged Kuriboh” is removed from play with “Disappear”, or shuffled back into the Deck with “Fiber Jar”.
*   Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it will not be negated by “Skill Drain” but it will be negated by “The End of Anubis”.
*   Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it is the original owner that will get the effect. So if the opponent took control with “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal”, if it is destroyed then it goes to the original owner’s Graveyard and they get the effect.
*   When “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, the activation of its effect can be chained to.
*   After the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” resolves, the application of the effect (making Battle Damage zero) does not start a chain and cannot be chained to.
*   If “Winged Kuriboh” is treated as an Equip Card (like if it’s equipped to “Relinquished”) and it’s destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect still activates.
*   If your opponent takes control of your “Winged Kuriboh” and when it tries to return to your control you have no open Monster Card Zones, “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, and its effect activates.

#### WINGED KURIBOH LV10

Individual Card FAQs:

*   “Winged Kuriboh LV10” has a Multi-Trigger Effect. You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.
*   The Multi-Trigger Effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”can be chained to. You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” or “My Body as a Shield” to the effect.
*   Tributing “Winged Kuriboh LV10” is a cost to activate its effect.
*   The “combined original ATK” of the destroyed monsters is calculated after the monsters are destroyed and are no longer on the field. So a destroyed “King of the Skull Servants” would add 0 damage to this effect, and a destroyed “Fusilier Dragon – the Dual Mode Beast” that was Summoned without Tribute would add 2800 damage.
*   You cannot activate “Level Up!” to send “Winged Kuriboh LV10” to the Graveyard because it does not have a monster’s name in its text.
*   You may return “Winged Kuriboh LV10” from your Graveyard to your Deck with the effect of “The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension”.
*   If an opponent’s monster cannot be destroyed by the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”, no damage is dealt for that monster’s ATK. For example, if “Master Monk” targeted by “Lone Wolf” is on the field, it is unaffected by monster effects, so it will not be destroyed and its 1900 original ATK points will not be inflicted to its controller.
*   You can activate the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10” if “Skill Drain” is on the field, and its effect will resolve normally and not be negated, because it is no longer a face-up monster on the field.

#### WINGED MINION

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If the Fiend-Type monster that received the ATK and DEF increase from this card’s effect is flipped face-down, the effect is reset and the ATK and DEF return to the original amounts.
*   You may Tribute two "Winged Minions" to increase the ATK and DEF of a Fiend-Type monster by 1400 points.
*   If the Fiend-Type monster that was selected for this card’s effect is changed into a different Type, by the effect of "DNA Surgery" for example, it retains the 700 point ATK and DEF increase.

#### WITCH OF THE BLACK FOREST

Individual Card FAQs:

*   You must show your opponent the monster you select from your Deck for this card’s effect. If you have no eligible monsters, your opponent gets to see your Deck to verify.
*   The effect of "Witch of the Black Forest" only activates when she is sent from the field to the Graveyard, not from your hand or Deck, and not if she is removed from play.
*   If the Summon of this card is negated with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment" you do not get its effect.
*   If you control your opponent’s "Witch of the Black Forest" and it is destroyed, your opponent gets the effect since it activates in his/her Graveyard.
*   You can chain to the activation of "Witch of the Black Forest"’s effect.

Netrep Rulings:

*   If “Witch of the Black Forest” is equipped to a monster and is sent from the fi eld to the Graveyard, the effect of “Witch of the Black Forest” will activate.

#### WOODLAND SPRITE

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Woodland Sprite" gives you the ability to send Equip Spell Cards equipped to it to the Graveyard. Sending them to the Graveyard for this specific purpose is the only way to activate the effect and inflict 500 points of damage to your opponent.
*   This card’s effect can only be activated during your Main Phase, but may be activated more than once per turn.
*   An Equip Spell Card sent to the Graveyard by this card’s effect is not "destroyed". So the effects of "Butterfly Dagger – Elma", "Axe of Despair", "Malevolent Nuzzler", "Blast with Chain", or "Smoke Grenade of the Thief" cannot or will not be activated.
*   If you send "Black Pendant" to the Graveyard with this card’s effect, the effect of "Black Pendant" will activate, because it does not have to be "destroyed", just sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate "Premature Burial" to Special Summon "Woodland Sprite" from your Graveyard, and then its effect to send "Premature Burial" to the Graveyard and "Woodland Sprite" will remain on the field. This is because "Premature Burial" was not destroyed.
*   If you opponent activates "Snatch Steal" and equips it to your "Woodland Sprite", they may choose to activate its effect and send "Snatch Steal" to the Graveyard. You will take 500 damage, and then control of "Woodland Sprite" would return to you.

#### WYNN THE WIND CHARMER

Individual Card FAQs:

*   If your opponent chains “Enemy Controller” to the activation of the Flip Effect of a “Charmer”, and takes control of the “Charmer”, the Flip Effect disappears.
*   If you take control of the opponent’s monster with a “Charmer” and the opponent takes control back with “Change of Heart”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Change of Heart” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.
*   If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.
*   If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.
*   If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.
*   If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.

#### BLAST WITH CHAIN

Netrep Rulings:

*   If the monster equipped with “Blast with Chain” is destroyed, “Blast with Chain’s” effect does not trigger. “Blast with Chain” must be destroyed by a card effect to trigger its effect.
*   “Blast with Chain” may be activated in the Damage Step.
*   The effect of “Blast with Chain” creates its own Chain when it activates in the Graveyard.
*   "Blast with Chain” will be destroyed by “Gearfried the Iron Knight’s” effect and will activate its "destroy 1 card" effect.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: If a face-down “Gearfried the Iron Knight” is attacked with a “Blue-Eyes White Dragon,” when it is turned face-up during Damage calculation, can the controller of “Gearfried the Iron Knight” activate “Blast with Chain” on “Gearfried the Iron Knight” and have it be destroyed and activate the second effect to destroy the “Blue-Eyes White Dragon?”  
    A: Yes, this scenario would work. bishop, 12/05/2003

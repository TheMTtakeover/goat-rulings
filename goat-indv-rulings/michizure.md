#### MICHIZURE

Netrep Rulings:

*   “Michizure” applies to monsters owned by the controller of “Michizure.”
*   “Michizure” may not be activated as a response to a Tribute.
*   “Michizure” may not be activated in the Damage Step.
*   “Michizure” may not be activated in response to a monster being sent to the Graveyard as a result of Battle.
*   “Michizure” may not be activated if the monster sent to the Graveyard was not a monster, such as “Dark Necrofear” or a monster equipped to “Thousand Eyes Restrict.”

Other Rulings:

*   "Michizure" may be activated during any phase of your turn or your opponent's turn (if it had been set in your prior turn or before). However, it can only be activated if the very last event is a chainable one that sent the controller's monster to the Graveyard.
*   "Michizure" cannot be used in response to a tribute for effects such as "Cannon Soldier," "Hysteric Fairy," "Tribe Infecting Virus," and the like since the last thing to happen is the effect of such cards, not the sending of the monster to the Graveyard.
*   The effect of "Michizure" targets a monster.
*   The effect of "Michizure" cannot be used if the monster is used as tribute for a Ritual Summon, as Fusion Summon material, or for the effect of "Metamorphosis" since the last thing to happen is the summon, not the monster being sent to the Graveyard.

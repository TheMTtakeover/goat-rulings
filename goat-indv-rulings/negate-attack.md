#### NEGATE ATTACK

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: Does “Negate Attack” stop the entire Battle Phase or just the Damage Step?  
    A: Negate Attack DOES stop the ENTIRE Battle Phase after it negates the opponent's attack. In other words, you are _NOT_ allowed to declare any more attacks, because the Battle Phase is over due to Negate Attack. Steve Okegawa, 01/02/2004

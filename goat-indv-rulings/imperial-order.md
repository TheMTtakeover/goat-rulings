#### IMPERIAL ORDER

Netrep Rulings:

*   Spell Cards may still be activated while “Imperial Order” is active.
*   If “Imperial Order” is not negated during the Standby Phase or if the 700 Life Point upkeep cost is not paid, “Imperial Order” is destroyed.
*   “Imperial Order” cannot be activated in the Damage Step.
*   If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is activated in a chain to the activation of “Imperial Order” and is not later negated, “Mystical Space Typhoon” will destroy “Imperial Order.”
*   If “Imperial Order” is activated in a chain with “Premature Burial” and is not negated, “Premature Burial” will not Special Summon a monster and will be sent to the Graveyard as it no longer has a legal target. If “Imperial Order” is activated after “Premature Burial” has resolved, as long as “Imperial Order” is active, if “Premature Burial” is destroyed, the monster equipped with “Premature Burial” will not be destroyed.
*   If “Snatch Steal” is negated by the effect of “Imperial Order,” the monster will remain equipped, but will remain under the control of the original controller as long as “Imperial Order” remains active. The opponent of the controller of “Snatch Steal” will not receive 1000 Life Points per Standby Phase as long as “Imperial Order” remains active.
*   If “Imperial Order” is active and “Swords of Revealing Light” is on the field, “Swords of Revealing Light” will remain on the field for its normal duration. As long as “Imperial Order” is active, “Swords of Revealing Light” will not prevent the opponent from attacking.
*   “Imperial Order” has no effect on the equipped monster of “Thousand Eyes Restrict.” “Thousand Eyes Restrict” will maintain the ATK and DEF value of the equipped monster.
*   If a Union monster is equipped to a monster and “Imperial Order” is active, the effect of the Union monster is negated. If a Union monster is equipped to a monster and “Imperial Order” is active, the Union monster may not use its effect to return to the monster field.

Netrep Q&As:

*   Q: In the event that the player has the exact amount of LP to pay for “Imperial Order,” they would be destroyed because paying for them would reduce the player's LP to zero?  
    A: This card does not have mandatory payments. The player controlling it can opt not to pay and the card would then be destroyed. They cannot choose to pay if it would make their Life Points become 0. Curtis Schultz, 12/23/2003
*   Q: If one opponent activates “Limiter Removal” and the other chains with “Imperial Order,” would the monsters not get the power up but still die.  
    A: “Imperial Order” negates all of “Limiter Removal's” effects. But if you use “Limiter Removal,” attack, and then activate “Imperial Order” during Main Phase 2, the machines are STILL destroyed. bishop, 12/05/2003
*   Q: Why is a card’s turn count ability (“Swords of Revealing Light”, “Final Countdown”, etc.) not considered part of its effect when being negated with “Imperial Order”?  
    A: “Imperial Order”’s presence on the field does not mean that the count of anything (phase, turn, etc) stops. bishop, 01/16/2004
*   Q: My opponent plays “Prohibition” and declares “Mystical Space Typhoon” and I chain “Imperial Order” to the activation; since “Imperial Order” just negates (not destroys) the “Prohibition” remains on the field and once “Imperial Order” leaves the field, it’s effect kicks in and “Mystical Space Typhoon” cannot be played. Is this true?  
    A: That is correct. When “Imperial Order” is negated or destroyed, the effect of “Prohibition” will resume being in effect and would then prohibit the declared card, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in this case. Curtis Schultz, 04/20/2004

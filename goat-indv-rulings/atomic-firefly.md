#### ATOMIC FIREFLY

Individual Card FAQs:

*   The card text is very correct on the card mechanics; "Atomic Firefly" has to be face-up BEFORE the attack is declared.
*   "Atomic Firefly"'s effect activates in the Graveyard when "Atomic Firefly" is sent to the Graveyard at the end of the attack, so "Skill Drain" will not negate its effect.
*   You can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Atomic Firefly"'s effect.

#### FROZEN SOUL

Individual Card FAQs:

*   While "Frozen Soul" is in effect, you cannot activate "Last Turn" in the same turn because "Last Turn" includes conducting a Battle Phase.
*   When you activate "Frozen Soul", and effects are chained that result in the Life Point difference being less than 2000, "Frozen Soul"'s effect still resolves.
*   When you activate "Frozen Soul", and your opponent skips his next Battle Phase somehow, his Battle Phase of the next turn is skipped with "Frozen Soul".

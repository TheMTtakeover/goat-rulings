#### GOBLIN OF GREED

Individual Card FAQs:

*   "Goblin of Greed" prevents discarding as a cost, but not as part of an effect. So "Goblin of Greed" will stop "Kuriboh", but not "Mirage of Nightmare" or "Graceful Charity".
*   If your opponent activates an effect and discards as a cost, and you chain "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Goblin of Greed", he doesn't stop the effect because the cost was already paid.

Netrep Rulings:

*   While “Goblin of Greed” is face-up and active on the field, effects that have an activation cost of discarding a card, like “Magic Jammer” or “Tribute to the Doomed” may not be activated. Effects that have an effect of discarding a card, or sending a card to the Graveyard, like “Graceful Charity” or “Mirage of Nightmare” may still be activated.

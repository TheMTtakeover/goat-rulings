<h2 id="card-rulings">Card Rulings</h2>

<h4 id="3-hump-lacooda">3-HUMP LACOODA</h4>

<p><em>(1) If there are 3 face-up “3-Hump Lacooda” cards on your side of the field, Tribute 2 of them to draw 3 cards.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) Ignition Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.</li>
  <li>You don’t have to activate “3-Hump Lacooda”’s effect just because you have 3 copies in play.</li>
  <li>You can choose which of the “3-Hump Lacoodas”’ effects you are activating;  it can be one of the ones you are Tributing or the one that is remaining on the field.</li>
  <li>Tributing 2 “3-Hump Lacoodas” is a cost.</li>
  <li>If your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” or “Book of Moon” to the  activation of “3-Hump Lacooda”’s effect, the effect is not negated.</li>
  <li>If you Summon your third “3-Hump Lacooda”, you can activate its effect before your opponent activates “Torrential Tribute”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="7">7</h4>

<p><em>When there are 3 face-up “7” cards on your side of the field, draw 3 cards  from your Deck. Then destroy all “7” cards. When this card is sent  directly from the field to your Graveyard, increase your Life Points by  700 points.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have 3 “7”’s and destroy them all, you get 2100 Life Points.</li>
  <li>If your opponent also has “7”’s, they are also destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you have 3 “7”’s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain “Imperial Order” to negate the effect.</li>
  <li>Each effect of “7” that gives you 700 Life Points goes on a chain, so if  multiple “7”’s are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the chain.</li>
  <li>If other cards are also sent to the  Graveyard at the same time, like “Sangan” or “Black Pendant”, the card  controlled by the turn player is Step 1.</li>
  <li>If your 3rd “7” is  activated, but destroyed by “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain, you  can’t activate its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its  Graveyard effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="8-claws-scorpion">8-CLAWS SCORPION</h4>

<p><em>(1) Once per turn, you can flip this card into face-down Defense Position.  (2) When this card attacks an opponent’s face-down Defense Position  monster, this card’s ATK becomes 2400 during damage calculation only.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) Ignition Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>If you use this effect, then Flip Summon this card: you cannot used this effect again that turn [<a href="https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-flip-flop-fundamentals">REF</a>].</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The (2) mandatory Trigger Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>This effect is applied if the condition is correct on activation (“8-Claws  Scorpion” declared an attack against a face-down Defense Position  monster.) The target monster does not have to be in face-down Defense  Position when the effect of “8-Claws Scorpion” is resolved. So if “Final Attack Orders” is active, or “Ceasefire” flips the monster face-up,  “8-Claws Scorpion” still gets its 2400 ATK.</li>
      <li>The ATK of “8-Claws  Scorpion” becomes 2400 during damage calculation. You cannot chain “Rush Recklessly” or “Blast with Chain” to this effect. If these cards were  activated before damage calculation, then the ATK of “8-Claws Scorpion”  becomes 2400 during damage calculation so those cards have no effect on  its ATK.</li>
      <li>Even if “8-Claws Scorpion” is equipped with an Equip  Spell Card, its ATK is 2400 when it attacks a face-down Defense Position monster.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-cat-of-ill-omen">A CAT OF ILL OMEN</h4>

<p><em>FLIP: Select 1 Trap Card from your Deck and place it on top of your Deck. If  “Necrovalley” is on the field, you can add the selected Trap Card to  your hand instead.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Show the card to your opponent.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” &amp; “Necrovalley” are both active, and “A Cat of Ill Omen” is flipped, you add the card to your hand because “Necrovalley”  is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.</li>
  <li>If  “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to the effect to destroy  “Necrovalley”, so that “Necrovalley” is not on the field when this  effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.</li>
  <li>You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-cell-breeding-device">‘A’ CELL BREEDING DEVICE</h4>

<p><em>(1) During each of your Standby Phases, put 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>You can select a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards  as the monster to put an A-Counter on, but the counter will not be  placed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-cell-incubator">‘A’ CELL INCUBATOR</h4>

<p><em>(1) Each time an A-Counter(s) is removed from play by a card effect, place 1 A-Counter on this card. (2) When this card is destroyed, distribute the A-Counters on this card among face-up monsters.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>This effect does not use the Chain.</li>
      <li>If an A-Counter is removed to pay a cost, an A-Counter is placed upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.</li>
      <li>If an A-Counter on this card is removed by an effect, place an A-Counter upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.</li>
      <li>The effect of “’A’ Cell Incubator” is not applied when A-Counters are  removed because the card with the A-Counters was removed from the field  or flipped face-down, because these A-Counters are not removed by an  effect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The (2) mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates &amp; resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
    <ul>
      <li>You may place A-Counters on face-up monsters on either field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-cell-scatter-burst">‘A’ CELL SCATTER BURST</h4>

<p><em>Select 1 face-up “Alien” monster you control. Destroy it and distribute new  A-Counters equal to its Level among your opponent’s face-up monsters.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>This effect targets 1 face-up “Alien” monster you control.</li>
  <li>You choose which monsters to put the A-Counters on when this effect resolves.</li>
  <li>You can distribute the A-Counters however you wish among your opponent’s face-up monsters.</li>
  <li>You must place exactly as many A-Counters as the Level of the monster targeted by this effect.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls no face-up monsters.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-deal-with-dark-ruler">A DEAL WITH DARK RULER</h4>

<p><em>You can only activate this card during a turn in which a Level 8 or higher  monster on your side of the field was sent to the Graveyard. Special  Summon 1 “Berserk Dragon” from your hand or Deck.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The “Level” in “A Deal with Dark Ruler” is the original Level printed on the Monster Card.</li>
  <li>If your opponent’s Level 8 or higher monster than you control is sent to  the Graveyard, you can activate “A Deal with Dark Ruler”.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “A Deal with Dark Ruler” during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>You can only Special Summon 1 monster with “A Deal with Dark Ruler”, but  you can activate 2 copies of “A Deal with Dark Ruler” to Special Summon 1 “Berserk Dragon” for each, even if only 1 Level 8 or higher monster was sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can activate “A Deal with Dark  Ruler” if your Level 8 or higher monster that is an Equip Spell Card is  sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard (such as “Koitsu” or  “Dark Necrofear” destroyed by “Heavy Storm”).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-feather-of-the-phoenix">A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX</h4>

<p><em>Discard 1 card. Select 1 card from your Graveyard and return it to the top of your Deck.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Discarding 1 card is a cost. Your opponent can chain “D.D. Crow”.</li>
  <li>This is an effect that targets.</li>
  <li>You can target a Fusion / Synchro Monster in the Graveyard, but it is returned to the Extra Deck.</li>
  <li>You can target the card you discarded for the cost of “A Feather of the  Phoenix” to be the card returned to the top of your Deck. If you  discarded “Night Assailant” or “Makyura the Destructor”, then their  effects will activate.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-feint-plan">A FEINT PLAN</h4>

<p><em>A player cannot attack face-down monsters during this turn.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If “A Feint Plan” is activated and you control only face-down monsters,  your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack  your Life Points directly either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you activate “A  Feint Plan” after your opponent declares an attack against one of your  face-down monsters, that attack resolves as normal, but they cannot  attack other face-down monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is  because “A Feint Plan” prevents declaring an attack against a face-down  monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time “A Feint  Plan” resolves during the Battle Step.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-hero-emerges">A HERO EMERGES</h4>

<p><em>You can only activate this card when your opponent declares an attack. Your opponent selects 1 random card from your hand. If it is a Monster Card, Special Summon it on your side of the field. If not, send it to the  Graveyard.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can Special Summon a high-level monster, like “Dark Magician”, with “A Hero Emerges”. But if your opponent selects a  Special Summon-only monster like “Dark Necrofear”, or a Spirit Monster,  it is sent to the Graveyard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When “Guardian Elma” is  selected for “A Hero Emerges”, and you have “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” on your side of the field, you can Special Summon her, but if you don’t  have it, then she is sent to the Graveyard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can activate “A Hero Emerges” even if you have only 1 card in your hand.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-legendary-ocean">A LEGENDARY OCEAN</h4>

<p><em>(C) This card’s name is treated as “Umi”. (1) Reduce the Level of all WATER monsters in both players’ hands and on the field by 1. (2) All WATER monsters gain 200 ATK and DEF.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (C) Condition cannot be negated, it applies in the Deck:
    <ul>
      <li>You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between “A Legendary Ocean” and  “Umi”, because this card’s name is treated as “Umi”. So you cannot have 3 copies of “Umi” and 3 copies of “A Legendary Ocean” in your Deck.</li>
      <li>The name of “A Legendary Ocean” is treated as “Umi” always and for all  purposes. If “Imperial Order” is active, the card name is still treated  as “Umi”. If the opponent activates “Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell” targeting “Umi”, you cannot activate “Umi” or “A Legendary Ocean” for  the rest of the Duel.</li>
      <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, you may activate “Tornado Wall”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER  Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4  monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show  your opponent.</li>
      <li>When the effect of “Cyber Jar” is activated and  “A Legendary Ocean” is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5  WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of “Cyber Jar”. This is because  the effect of “A Legendary Ocean” does not include Monster Cards in the  Deck.</li>
      <li>If “A Legendary Ocean” and “Gravity Bind” are active, you  may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If “A Legendary Ocean” is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay  occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.</li>
      <li>If “A Legendary Ocean” and “Infinite Dismissal” are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be  destroyed during the End Phase.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The (2) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, “The Legendary Fisherman” on the field  is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus  or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your  hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.</li>
      <li>“A Legendary Ocean” does not have the effect of “Umi” that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-man-with-wdjat">A MAN WITH WDJAT</h4>

<p><em>(1) When you Normal Summon this card, and during each of your Standby  Phases, select 1 Set card on your opponent’s side of the field. Pick it  up and look at it, then return it to its original position.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you Set “A Man with Wdjat”, its effect is not activated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Any effects of the card you look at are not activated when you look at them with “A Man with Wdjat” (such as a Flip Effect, or if it is a Trap  Card, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-rival-appears">A RIVAL APPEARS!</h4>

<p><em>Select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Special Summon 1 monster from your hand that has the same Level as the selected monster.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For the effect of “A Rival Appears!”, refer to the levels of the monster on the field and the monster in the hand at the time “A Rival Appears!”  resolves (for purposes of “Cost Down”, “Level Conversion Lab”, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain destroying “Demotion”, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the opponent’s monster is face-down or not on the field when “A Rival Appears!” resolves, then its effect disappears.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not have a monster of the same level as the target, you cannot activate “A Rival Appears!”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-wingbeat-of-giant-dragon">A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON</h4>

<p><em>Return 1 face-up Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster you control to the owner’s hand and destroy all Spell and Trap Cards.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” targets 1 Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you target a Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type Fusion / Synchro Monster, it is returned to the Extra Deck.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field / has its Monster  Type changed, “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon’s” effect disappears.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abare-ushioni">ABARE USHIONI</h4>

<p><em>(1) Once per turn, you can toss a coin and call it. If you call it right,  inflict 1000 damage to your opponent. If you call it wrong, you take  1000 damage.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) Ignition Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you call the coin toss wrong for “Abare Ushioni” you can still prevent the damage with “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the effect of “Abare Ushioni”  because you don’t know yet if you will take damage or not from the  effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="absolute-end">ABSOLUTE END</h4>

<p><em>Activate only during your opponent’s turn. This turn, the attacks from your opponent’s monsters become direct attacks.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When “Absolute End” is activated during an attack, that attack becomes a direct attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If “Taunt” and “Absolute End” are both active, the attack becomes a direct attack to your Life Points. This is because the attack target is the  monster selected by “Taunt”, but then “Absolute End” turns it into a  direct attack.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="absorbing-kid-from-the-sky">ABSORBING KID FROM THE SKY</h4>

<p><em>(1) When this card destroys a monster and sends it to the Graveyard as a  result of battle, increase your Life Points by the Level of the  destroyed monster x 300 points.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.</li>
      <li>This card must be face-up on the field to activate this effect [<a href="https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-will-it-trigger">REF</a>].</li>
      <li>The Level is the original Level printed on the card.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abyssal-designator">ABYSSAL DESIGNATOR</h4>

<p><em>Pay 1000 Life Points. Declare a Type and an Attribute. Your opponent must  send 1 monster with both the declared Type and Attribute from their hand or Deck to the Graveyard.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If your opponent sends a monster  to the Graveyard with the declared Type and Attribute, you cannot see  their hand and Deck. But if they claim to have no such card, you can  check their hand and Deck to confirm.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="acid-trap-hole">ACID TRAP HOLE</h4>

<p><em>Select 1 face-down Defense Position monster. Flip it face-up, and if the DEF  of the monster is 2000 points or less, destroy the monster. If the DEF  is more than 2000 points, return the monster to face-down Defense  Position.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A face-down “Jinzo” will be destroyed by this card.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as “Enraged Muka Muka”, calculate the current DEF, then determine if it  will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in  your hand, “Enraged Muka Muka” would not be destroyed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated  whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected  monster is 2000 or less, such as a “Hane-Hane”, it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="adhesion-trap-hole">ADHESION TRAP HOLE</h4>

<p><em>Activate only when your opponent Summons a monster(s). While that monster(s) is  face-up on the field, its original ATK is halved.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Adhesion Trap Hole” works against “a monster or monsters”, so “Adhesion Trap Hole” does NOT target.</p>
  </li>
  <li>When “Cyber Jar” is activated, you may use “Adhesion Trap Hole” against all  monsters your opponent Special Summons in face-up Attack Position, but  “Adhesion Trap Hole” has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons face-down.</li>
  <li>“Adhesion Trap Hole” cannot affect monsters Special Summoned face-down with “The Shallow Grave”, “Morphing Jar #2”, etc.</li>
  <li>If a monster affected by “Adhesion Trap Hole” is flipped face-down (with  “Book of Moon”, etc.), “Adhesion Trap Hole”’s effect disappears and the  monster’s ATK is back to normal.</li>
  <li>
    <p>“Adhesion Trap Hole” halves the original ATK, so if you activate another effect that alters ATK, halve  the original ATK first and then resolve the other ATK-modifying effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If a monster affected by “Adhesion Trap Hole” is then equipped with “Megamorph”, only “Megamorph”’s effect applies.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="adhesive-explosive">ADHESIVE EXPLOSIVE</h4>

<p><em>(1) If an opponent’s monster attacks this face-down Defense Position card,  this card becomes an Equip Card equipped to the attacking monster,  without applying damage calculation. (2) Destroy the equipped monster  during the Standby Phase of your opponent’s next turn.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates &amp; resolves on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>This effect activates in Substep 3 - Before Damage Calculation.</li>

      <li>If “Allure Queen LV7” is  Special Summoned by the effect of “Allure Queen LV5”, and is then  permanently removed from play with “D.D.

    <p>Sending a monster to the Graveyard for “Altar for Tribute” is a cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can select a Token Monster as the cost for “Altar for Tribute”, but you won’t gain any Life Points because Tokens are taken off the field  instead of going to the Graveyard.</p>

<p><em>You can activate this card when your opponent declares an attack and if  there is a monster(s) on your side of the field that includes  “Amazoness” in its card name, or is named “Amazon Archer”. All monsters  on your opponent’s side of the field are changed to face-up Attack  Position (Flip Effects are not activated), and as long as they remain  face-up on the field, their ATK(s) are decreased by 500 points. Your  opponent must attack with all of his/her monsters.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“These  monsters” means all of your opponent’s face-up monsters on the field at  the time “Amazoness Archers” resolves, not just the monsters that were  flipped by “Amazoness Archers”’ effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you activate “Amazoness Archers” during the Battle Phase and your opponent Special  Summons another monster afterwards (such as with “Call of the Haunted”,  or if “Cyber Jar” is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not  affected by “Amazoness Archers” and does not suffer the -500 ATK  reduction nor does it have to attack.</li>
  <li>The -500 ATK applies to  each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You  can activate multiple “Amazoness Archers” and the ATK reductions are  cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies).</li>
  <li>“Amazoness Archers” vs. “Cat’s Ear Tribe”: the ATK is 200.</li>
  <li>If “Fushioh Richie” or “Otohime” are flipped face-up by “Amazoness  Archers’ effect, their effects are activated because their effects are  not Flip Effects; their effects begin a new chain that resolves after  the current chain.</li>
  <li>If a face-down “Jinzo” is flipped by “Amazoness Archers”, “Amazoness Archers”’ effect is not negated.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Amazoness Archers” will make your opponent have to attack  with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the  field. If “Amazoness Archers” is in effect, and later a replay occurs,  your opponent cannot choose not to attack.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have  already attacked cannot attack again. If “The Dark Door” is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot  attack still cannot attack (Toon Monsters the turn they are Summoned,  “Ultimate Obedient Fiend” under the wrong conditions, etc.) If  “Diffusion Wave-Motion” is in effect, only the monster affected by  “Diffusion Wave-Motion” can attack. The ATK reduction of “Amazoness  Archers” is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you activate “Amazoness Archers” and chain “Magic Cylinder”, “Magic  Cylinder” does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your  opponent’s other monsters must attack normally. If you chain “Amazoness  Archers” to “Magic Cylinder”, the ATK is reduced first and then “Magic  Cylinder” does damage.</p>

      <li>If you have your opponent’s monster that you acquired with “Amazoness  Chain Master”, and your opponent activates “Disturbance Strategy”, the  monster returns to the owner’s Deck. However, you draw the same number  of cards that you had in your hand, including 1 card for the monster you acquired with “Amazoness Chain Master”.</li>
      <li>If you acquired your  opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master”, and “Remove  Brainwashing” is activated, the monster returns to the original owner if it is on the field. However, if it’s still in your hand then it is not  returned.</li>

  <li>
    <p>If you switch ATKs with “Amazoness Spellcaster”, and one of the monsters  is equipped with “Megamorph”, after the switch, you change the ATK of  the monster that is equipped with “Megamorph” using the effect of  “Megamorph”.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Note that “Amplifier”’s activation and effect cannot be negated. This is written on the card.</p>
  </li>
  <li>It is the controller of “Jinzo” equipped with “Amplifier”, not the controller of “Amplifier”, that can activate Trap Cards.</li>

  <li>If you have “Jinzo with Amplifier”, your Trap Cards are not negated and  their effects are applied, including “Aqua Chorus”, “Royal Command”,  “Royal Oppression”, “Coffin Seller”, “Forced Requisition”, “Mirror  Wall”, “Gravity Bind”, “Rivalry of Warlords”, “Minor Goblin Official”,  “Final Attack Orders”, “Pitch Black Power Stone”, “Bad Reaction to  Simochi”, “Skull Invitation”, “Skull Lair”, “The Eye of Truth”, “Spirit  Invitation”, “Respect Play”, “Ring of Destruction”, “Metalmorph”,  “Torrential Tribute”, “Self-Destruct Button”, “Zero Gravity”, and “Big  Burn”.</li>

  <li>
    <p>If your “Amplifier” is  switched from your “Jinzo” to your opponent’s “Jinzo” with “Tailor of  the Fickle”, then your Jinzo is not destroyed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You  cannot activate a card that would cause an infinite loop because its  effect cannot resolve completely. Example #1: You activate “Snatch  Steal” targeting your opponent’s “Jinzo”. You then equip “Jinzo” with  “Amplifier”. You cannot activate “Imperial Order” because it cannot  resolve completely (it would negate “Snatch Steal”, returning “Jinzo” to your opponent, which would negate “Imperial Order” so “Snatch Steal”  would re-activate). If you activate “Imperial Order” by mistake in such a situation, flip it face-down again. Example #2: you control “Jinzo”  equipped with “Amplifier” and “Skill Drain”. Your opponent cannot  activate “Royal Decree”.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While “Final Attack Orders” is active, if you attack a face-down Defense Position monster, the monster is changed to Attack Position, then damage calculation is applied with the monster in Attack Position.</li>
  <li>While “Final Attack Orders” is active, you can change monsters like “Guardian Sphinx” to face-down Defense Position, and while they are face-down, “Final Attack Orders” has no effect on them.</li>
  <li>While “Final Attack Orders” is active, you can change the Battle Positions of monsters with “Curse of Fiend” or “Little-Winguard”, but the Battle Positions are immediately changed back to Attack Position by “Final Attack Orders”.</li>
  <li>While “Final Attack Orders” is active, effects of “Goblin Attack Force”, “Giant Orc”, and “Dark Zebra” are resolved, but they are immediately changed back to Attack Position.</li>
  <li>While “Final Attack Orders” and “Light of Intervention” are active, you can Special Summon a monster in face-up Defense Position, but it is immediately changed to Attack Position.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Final Attack Orders” cannot be chained to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While “Final Attack Orders” is active, neither player may perform a manual change of position of any face-up Attack Position monsters.</li>
  <li>Monster Tokens will be forced into Attack Position by the effect of “Final Attack Orders.”</li>
  <li>Monsters flipped face-up by an attack are immediately forced into Attack Position by “Final Attack Orders” before Damage Calculation. Monsters that change position via an effect will immediately change back to Attack Position if it remains face-up.</li>
  <li>If two continuous effects like that of “Final Attack Orders” determine a position for a monster, the most recently resolved takes precedence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Opponent attacks “Crass Clown” while it is face-down on the field with a monster that has an ATK of 1400 or higher and “Final Attack Orders” is active on the field. After flipping “Crass Clown” face-up, does it turn into Attack Position triggering its effect before being destroyed by the attack?<br />
A: Yes it would get its effect, but the effect will activate during the “Resolve Monster Effects” portion of the Damage Step, which is after damage calculation. Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Waboku” makes Battle Damage dealt by your opponent’s monsters to your monsters and to your Life Points become zero.</li>
  <li>“Waboku” applies to ALL of the monsters on that player’s side of the field for the entire turn.</li>
  <li>To illustrate how “Waboku” works, here are some scenarios and their results:</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 1: Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” attacks Player B’s “Mega Thunderball”, and Player B activates “Waboku”. RESULT: Player A’s (attacking) “Mega Thunderball” is destroyed. Player B’s “Mega Thunderball” (with equal ATK) is NOT destroyed.</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 2: Player A activates “Waboku”. Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” then attacks Player B’s “Mega Thunderball”. RESULT: Player B’s “Mega Thunderball” is destroyed. Player A’s (attacking) “Mega Thunderball” is NOT destroyed. So you can use “Waboku” “offensively” when attacking an equal ATK monster.</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 3: Player A activates “Waboku”. Player A’s “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” then attacks Player B’s “Sanga of the Thunder”. Player B uses “Sanga of the Thunder”’s effect (during the Damage Step). RESULT: Player A’s “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” (ATK 0) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any Life Points, because of Player A’s “Waboku”.</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 4: Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” attacks Player B’s “Mega Thunderball”. Player B activates “Fairy Box” or “Mirror Wall”. Player A activates “Waboku”. RESULT: Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” (with reduced ATK) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any life points, because of Player A’s “Waboku”. But because Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” had reduced ATK, Player B’s “Mega Thunderball” is not destroyed either.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Waboku” may not be activated in the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>“Waboku” lasts for the turn it was activated in.</li>
  <li>“Waboku’s” effect applies to all monsters on the side of the field of the player who activated “Waboku.”</li>
  <li>“Waboku” only changes the battle damage of a monster inflicts to the controller of “Waboku” to 0.</li>
  <li>“Waboku” does not alter ATK value.</li>
  <li>If a monster protected by “Waboku” is attacked by or attacks a monster with the same ATK value that is not protected by “Waboku,” the other monster is destroyed in battle as normal.</li>
  <li>Face-down monsters attacked while protected by “Waboku” will still flip face up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Player A declares an attack with a monster that has an equal ATK as the opponent’s monster. Player B activates “Waboku.” Player A chains with “Waboku.” What happens to the two monsters?<br />
A: Neither monster would be destroyed by the attack. Curtis Schultz, 01/14/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If “Waboku” has been activated, will the damage from “Rod of the Mind’s Eye” or “Dark Scorpion Combination” be applied or will it also be reduced to 0?<br />
A: The Battle Damage will still be reduced to 0 by the effect of “Waboku.” Curtis Schultz, 02/18/2004</li>
</ul>

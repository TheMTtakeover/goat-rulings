<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Asura Priest” may attack directly if it has not already attacked a monster this turn.</li>
  <li>“Asura Priest” cannot attack a monster if it has already attacked directly this turn. For example, the opponent activates “Call of the Haunted” or “Scapegoat” after “Asura Priest” has completed a direct attack.</li>
  <li>“Asura Priest” may attack each monster only once. If the opponent controls “Spirit Reaper” you cannot continually attack it.</li>
  <li>When cards like “Gravekeeper’s Servant” or “Toll” are active on the field, you must pay each time “Asura Priest” attacks.</li>
  <li>“Asura Priest” attacks each monster one a time. Resolve the battle with one monster before declaring an attack on another monster.</li>
  <li>“Asura Priest” does not have to attack all monsters on your opponent’s side of the field. If you opponent controls 3 monsters, you may choose to attack only 2 of them.</li>
  <li>When “Asura Priest” attacks and destroys “Giant Rat” or “Masked Dragon”, you may then attack the monster Special Summoned by the effect of those monsters.</li>
  <li>After “Asura Priest” has attacked monsters, other monsters you control may still attack directly.</li>
  <li>“Asura Priest” can attack each monster once during the same Battle Phase. These attacks do not have to be all in a row. For example, you can attack monsters with “Asura Priest”, then attack with another monster, and “Asura Priest” can still attack again as long as it attacks a monster it has not attacked yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Asura Priest” does not return to the player’s hand if it is not face-up on the field during the End Phase of the turn it was turned face-up.</li>
  <li>The ‘you cannot attack your opponent directly’ text on “Asura Priest” refers specifically to an “Asura Priest” that has already attacked a monster on the opponent’s field. If “Asura Priest” has attacked a monster, that “Asura Priest” may not attack Life Points directly.</li>
  <li>Each of “Asura Priest’s” attacks are separate Battle Steps.</li>
</ul>

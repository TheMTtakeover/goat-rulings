  <li>When your opponent’s monster on your side of the field that you control with “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” is removed with “Different Dimension Gate”, it returns to your side of the field when “Different Dimension Gate” is destroyed, and then immediately returns to your opponent’s side of the field.</li>

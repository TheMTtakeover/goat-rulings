<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Night Assailant” in your hand is destroyed by the effect of “Deck Devastation Virus”, its effect will activate.</li>
  <li>Monsters with “?” for ATK are treated as having an ATK of zero for this effect, while they are in the hand or face-down.</li>
  <li>If “Deck Devastation Virus” is active and you activate “Graceful Charity”, first draw 3 cards, then discard 2 cards for the effect of “Graceful Charity”, then, if any of the monsters you drew with “Graceful Charity” are still in your hand and they have ATK 1500 or less, they are destroyed. Similarly, if you activate “Good Goblin Housekeeping”, return the 1 card to the bottom of your deck, and then destroy any monsters in your hand with ATK 1500 or less.</li>
  <li>The turn that “Deck Devastation Virus” is activated counts as the first turn. If you activate “Deck Devastation Virus” during your own turn, the “first turn” lasts until the end of your opponent’s next turn.</li>
  <li>You also check face-down monsters on the field for “Deck Devastation Virus”. If “Maju Garzett” is face-down on the field, its ATK is treated as zero so it will be destroyed.</li>
  <li>You only check the cards on the field and in the hand when “Deck Devastation Virus” is resolved. Only cards drawn are checked until the end of the third End Phase.</li>
  <li>If you return “Sinister Serpent” to your hand after “Deck Devastation Virus” has resolved, it will NOT be destroyed, because it was not drawn.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Premature Burial” to Speical Summon “D.D. Warrior Lady” from your Graveyard during the turns after “Deck Devastation Virus” has resolved, it will not be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you use “Change of Heart” to take control of your opponent’s “Magicial Scientist” during the turns after “Deck Devastation Virus” has resolved, it will not be destroyed. If you then use its effect to Special Summon “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”, it will also not be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you have the four limbs of Exodia in your hand when your opponent activates “Deck Devastation Virus” they will be destroyed. You can use two “Backup Soldier” to return them to your hand and they will not be destroyed (they were not drawn). If on your next turn you then draw “Exodia the Forbidden One” you will win the game before “Exodia the Forbidden One” is destroyed by the effect of “Deck Devastation Virus”.</li>
  <li>You can Tribute a face-down DARK monster with 2000 ATK for the cost of this card.</li>

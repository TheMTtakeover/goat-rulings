<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the targeted monster is a Flip Effect Monster, it is not flipped face-up and its Flip Effect is not activated. Both players must reveal their Decks to each other to verify that all cards of the same name as the Flip Effect Monster are removed from play.</li>
  <li>The targeted monster, and any cards of the same name if the target was a Flip Effect Monster, are removed from play and never go to the Graveyard, so the effects of cards like “Sangan” will not activate.</li>
  <li>Cards of the same name in your hand or on the field are NOT removed from play.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If I remove a card, say with “Nobleman of Crossout”, must my opponent show me their Deck to prove it contains no remaining copies? What if the card is “Fiber Jar”?<br />
A: A game penalty would be in order should more than one “Fiber Jar” be in someone’s deck. Of course, this should have already been resolved by a deck check prior to the tournament. To answer your question more generally, however, “Nobleman of Crossout” would allow for an opponent to check your deck to ensure compliance to the resolution of the effect. bishop, 01/23/2004</li>

<p>Other Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your opponent may indeed ask that you prove there are no more of that card in your deck. It is their right to do so. The ruling is in place in order to allow the opponent the opportunity to verify that you do not have a 2nd or 3rd copy… Unfortunately, the ruling opens the door, that the opponent gets a chance to look at your deck. Now, you do NOT give your deck to your opponent, but you may fan through it to verify that there is not another card of that name in it. The opponent may NOT take the time to stop and read card effects, look at other cards, or use this as a stalling technique themselves. This almost comes down to a courtesy that if you don’t look at mine, I won’t look at yours, or if you look at mine, I will look at yours. So this part of the ruling almost never comes up in play.

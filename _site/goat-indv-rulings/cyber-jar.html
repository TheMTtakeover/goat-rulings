<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spirit Monsters, Toon Monsters, Ritual Monsters, etc. are sent to your hand as they cannot be Special Summoned or must be Special Summoned is a specific way.</li>
  <li>Both players reveal all 5 cards to each other, and then the turn player may Special Summon his monsters, then the opponent. After revealing the cards, you may shuffle them around so you can Special Summon monsters face-down without the opponent knowing which monster is which.</li>
  <li>If “Sangan” or “Witch of the Black Forest” was destroyed by “Cyber Jar”’s effect, Special Summon monsters first and then complete “Sangan”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If you attacked your opponent’s face-down “Cyber Jar,” after its effect resolves you can then attack with any monsters you Special Summoned in Attack Position before you enter your Main Phase 2.</li>
  <li>“Torrential Tribute” can be used on monsters Summoned by “Cyber Jar” but not if “Cyber Jar” was flipped face-up in the Damage Step, since “Torrential Tribute” cannot be activated during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>If a player has less than 5 cards in their Deck, they do not lose (since you are picking-up cards, not drawing), they pick up however many cards they have and continue with “Cyber Jar”’s effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cards revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2” are not considered in the hand. The one star reduction given by “A Legendary Ocean” does not apply to monsters revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2’s” effect.</li>
  <li>“Cost Down” has no effect on the monsters revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2” as the monsters are never considered in the hand.</li>
  <li>If “Final Attack Orders” is active after “Cyber Jar’s” effect has resolved, each player may still Special Summon appropriate monsters in face-down Defense Position.</li>
  <li>If “Ground Collapse” is active and more monsters would be summoned through the effect of “Cyber Jar” than there are available monster spaces, the controller of the summoned monsters determine which will be Special Summoned and which will be sent to the Graveyard. Monsters that go to the Graveyard in this way are considered being sent from the Deck to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If Special Summon monsters are revealed through the effect of “Cyber Jar”, including “Relinquished”, “Toons”, or similar, they are sent to the hand.</li>
</ul>

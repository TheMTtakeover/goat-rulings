<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you use this card on a Trap Card that was just Set this turn, the timing is incorrect so the Trap is destroyed. If you use this card and activate a Trap Card with a cost, and that Trap Card’s activation timing is correct, its owner must pay all possible costs. If they cannot pay the costs, the Trap Card is negated and destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Bait Doll” is activated and targets an “Imperial Order” the opponent may chain the “Imperial Order” which will negate the effect of “Bait Doll” and it will not be returned to your Deck. Or the opponent can allow “Bait Doll” to force the activation of “Imperial Order”, and “Bait Doll” will be shuffled into the Deck and “Imperial Order” will remain active on the field because the timing of its activation was legitimate.</li>
  <li>If “Bait Doll” is activated and targets “Magic Jammer”, “Magic Drain”, etc. the opponent may chain the Trap Card to negate and destroy “Bait Doll”. If he / she does not, the Trap Card will be destroyed since the activation timing is incorrect, and “Bait Doll” will be shuffled into your Deck.</li>
  <li>You cannot chain to a Trap Card that was forced to activate by the effect of “Bait Doll” since an existing Chain is in the middle of resolving.</li>
  <li>If “Jinzo” is face-up on the field and the effect of “Bait Doll” forces the activation of a Normal or Counter Trap Card, that Trap Card’s effect is negated and the Trap Card is destroyed. If a Continuous Trap Card is forced to activate by the effect of “Bait Doll” it will remain face-up on the field meaninglessly until “Jinzo” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If the target of “Bait Doll” is no longer on the field (if it was sent to the Graveyard with “Emergency Provisions”, or destroyed by “Mystical Space Typhoon”, as a chain to the activation of “Bait Doll”), then “Bait Doll” is still shuffled back into the Deck. As long as the activation and effect of “Bait Doll” are not negated, the effect of “Bait Doll” that shuffles it back into the Deck still resolves.</li>
  <li>If “Chain Burst” is active on the field and you use “Bait Doll” to activate the opponent’s Trap Card, and its timing is correct, the opponent takes the 1000 points of damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Bait Doll” targets a face-down “Statue of the Wicked”, “Bait Doll” will force the activation of “Statue of the Wicked” and destroy it. “Statue of the Wicked’s” effect will not activate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your opponent has only 1 monster on the field you cannot activate this card.</li>
  <li>If a monster that has already attacked, or a monster targeted with the effect of “Spellbinding Circle” or “Nightmare Wheel” is targeted with the effect of “Dark Spirit of the Silent” that monster still attacks.</li>
  <li>If “Zombyra the Dark” is selected with “Dark Spirit of the Silent” and you have no monsters, “Zombyra the Dark” may attack directly.</li>
  <li>If “Hayabusa Knight” or “Mataza the Zapper” is selected with “Dark Spirit of the Silent” it only attacks once, but it may then attack twice per its own effect during the same Battle Phase.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have a cost to attack such as “Dark Elf” that are selected with “Dark Spirit of the Silent” do not need to have their costs paid to attack.</li>
  <li>If “Dark Spirit of the Silent” selects a face-up Defense Position “Crass Clown” as a target, the effect of “Crass Clown” activates when it is changed to Attack Position.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A monster forced to attack by the effect of “Dark Spirit of the Silent” is still allowed its normal attack that Battle Phase.</li>
  <li>Monsters that would normally not be able to attack must attack if targeted by “Dark Spirit of the Silent.”</li>
  <li>If “Spear Dragon” is forced to attack by the effect of “Dark Spirit of the Silent,” that “Spear Dragon” will be changed to Defense position after the resolution of the attack as per the effect of “Spear Dragon.”</li>
</ul>

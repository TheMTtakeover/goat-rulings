<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” constitutes a targeting effect.</li>
  <li>The player using “Call of the Haunted” must declare the monster to be Special Summoned at the time of activation.</li>
  <li>If the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” is sent to the Graveyard, but not destroyed, “Call of the Haunted” remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” is returned to the hand, “Call of the Haunted remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” is Tributed, “Call of the Haunted” remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If that monster is not in the Graveyard at the time of resolution, “Call of the Haunted” resolves without effect and remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” may be used to Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard during either player’s Battle Phase. If “Call of the Haunted” is successfully resolved during the opponent’s Battle Phase as a response to an attack declaration, a Replay is triggered.</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” may not be activated during the Damage Step.”</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed in a chain to the activation of “Call of the Haunted,” the monster that would be Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” is not Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” does not equip itself to “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” “Gearfried the Iron Knight” can be successfully summoned by “Call of the Haunted.”</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” can Special Summon “Jinzo.” If “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed while “Jinzo” is face-up on the field, the monster targeted by “Call of the Haunted” will not be destroyed. If “Jinzo” is Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” and “Jinzo” is destroyed, “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If the opponent plays “Monster Reborn” targeting a specific monster in a player’s Graveyard, and “Call of the Haunted” is chained to the activation of “Monster Reborn” targeting the same monster, “Call of the Haunted” will resolve first removing that monster from the Graveyard. “Monster Reborn” will resolve without effect.</li>
  <li>If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is activated in a chain with the activation of “Call of the Haunted,” “Mystical Space Typhoon” will destroy the “Call of the Haunted” before “Call of the Haunted” Special Summons a monster. “Call of the Haunted’s” effect will then disappear. If “Call of the Haunted” is activated in a chain with a “Mystical Space Typhoon” that targets “Call of the Haunted,” “Call of the Haunted” will resolve first, Special Summoning a monster. “Mystical Space Typhoon” will then resolve destroying the “Call of the Haunted.” If “Call of the Haunted” is not negated at this point, the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” will be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is used to Special Summon “Tyrant Dragon” and resolves successfully, “Call of the Haunted” will be negated and destroyed after “Tyrant Dragon” has been Special Summoned. “Tyrant Dragon” will remain on the field.</li>
  <li>If a Union monster like “Koitsu” is Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” and then uses its effect to equip itself to its Union counterpart, “Call of the Haunted” will no longer affect the Union monster and will remain face-up on the field meaninglessly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Call Of The Haunted” was used to Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard and then “Book of Moon” was activated, or the monster’s own effect such as “Guardian Sphinx”, what would happen?<br />
A: The targeted monster would be changed to face-down Defense Position and would then be severed from the effect of “Call of the Haunted.” Even if the monster is later flipped face-up, it will still remain severed from the effect of “Call of the Haunted.” “Call of the Haunted” will remain on the field meaninglessly.

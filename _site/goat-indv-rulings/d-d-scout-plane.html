<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is the OWNER of “D.D. Scout Plane” that Special Summons it. Even if your opponent controls your “D.D. Scout Plane”, if it is removed from play, you get to Special Summon it.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have a vacant Monster Card Zone when “D.D. Scout Plane” would be Special Summoned, “D.D. Scout Plane” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>“D.D. Scout Plane”’s effect activates whether it is removed from your hand, Deck, Graveyard, or the field.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is removed from play and is face-down while out of play, such as with “Lightforce Sword” or “Different Dimension Capsule”, “D.D. Scout Plane”’s effect does not activate. But if “D.D. Scout Plane” was face-down on the field, and was removed by “Nobleman of Crossout”, it is placed face-up while out of play and its effect does activate.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is face-down on the field while “Banisher of the Light” is in play, and “D.D. Scout Plane” is destroyed by “Raigeki Break”, it is removed from play and its effect activates because it is placed face-up out of play.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des” and then removed from play to Special Summon “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, “D.D. Scout Plane”’s effect activates and it will be Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is destroyed by “Lesser Fiend”, “D.D. Scout Plane”’s effect activates and it is Special Summoned even if “Dark Ruler Ha Des” was also in play when it was destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is removed during an End Phase, it is Special Summoned with its effect during that same End Phase.</li>
  <li>“D.D. Scout Plane”’s effect can only activate once during the same End Phase, so if a combo of “Banisher of the Light” and “King Tiger Wanghu” is set up, “D.D. Scout Plane” will only be Special Summoned once.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is removed from play and then returned to the Graveyard with “Miracle Dig” the same turn, its effect is reset and it remains in the Graveyard and is not Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>If “Prohibition” was used and “D.D. Scout Plane” is prohibited, “D.D. Scout Plane” cannot be Special Summoned and remains removed from play.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is removed from play with “Different Dimension Gate”, “D.D. Scout Plane”’s effect activates and “D.D. Scout Plane” is Special Summoned. If “Different Dimension Gate” is later destroyed, the other removed monster is returned to the field at that time.</li>

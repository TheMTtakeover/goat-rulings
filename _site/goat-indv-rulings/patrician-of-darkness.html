<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For this card’s effect, the chosen attack target must still be legal. You cannot force a monster to attack directly if it normally cannot, or force a monster to attack a monster on its own side of the field.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Patrician of Darkness” does not override the effects of “Marauding Captain”, “The Legendary Fisherman”, “Solar Flare Dragon”, etc. You cannot choose an attack target prevented by the effects of these cards. Examples: You cannot choose “The Legendary Fisherman” as an attack target if “Umi” is on the field. You cannot choose another Warrior-Type monster as an attack target when you control “Marauding Captain”.</li>
  <li>“Inaba White Rabbit” must still attack your Life Points directly since it is not able to attack other monsters. You cannot force it to with this card’s effect.</li>
  <li>If a monster has the optional effect of attacking directly, such as “Rainbow Flower”, you may choose a monster as an attack, or a direct attack.</li>
  <li>When you control “Patrician of Darkness” and a monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” you must chose the equipped monster as the attack target.</li>
  <li>Replays may occur as normal when this card is on the field. If, after the replay, “Patrician of Darkness” is still on the field and they choose to restart the attack, you will still choose the attack target with the effect of “Patrician of Darkness”.</li>
  <li>If you control “Patrician of Darkness” and “Lord of D.” you may still choose Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as attack targets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If there is more than one “Patrician of Darkness” on the field, does this create a non-attacking situation?<br />
A: No. Even if you have multiple “Patrician of Darkness” on your side of the field, the effect is not repeated. You will select a monster on your side of the field to be the monster your opponent will attack. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004</li>

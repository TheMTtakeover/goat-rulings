<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“My Body as a Shield” will negate cards such as “Dark Hole”, “Fissure”, “Raigeki”, “Eternal Rest”, “Nobleman of Crossout”, “Tribute to the Doomed”, “Thousand Knives”, “Trap Hole”, “Two-Pronged Attack”, “Mirror Force”, “House of Adhesive Tape”, “Eatgaboon”, “Ring of Destruction”, “Torrential Tribute”, “Bottomless Trap Hole”, “Man-Eater Bug”, “Blast Juggler”, “Dragon Seeker”, “Dream Clown”, “Throwstone Unit”, “Burst Breath”, “Swarm of Scarabs”, “Cyber Jar”, “Tribe-Infecting Virus”, “Raigeki Break”, “XYZ Dragon Cannon”, “Mega-Ton Magical Cannon”, “Exiled Force” (negates the effect but will not destroy “Exiled Force” as it is already in the Graveyard), “Offerings to the Doomed” (negates “Offerings to the Doomed” so you do not skip your Draw Phase), “Jowgen the Spiritualist” (when its effect is activated), “Dragon’s Gunfire” (if the effect that destroys a monster is selected), or “The Last Warrior From Another Planet” (negates the effect and destroys “The Last Warrior From Another Planet”).</li>
  <li>“My Body as a Shield” can only be used against effects that will destroy monsters at that time. So you cannot use “My Body as a Shield” when “Tribe-Infecting Virus” is summoned; you can only use it in response to the activation of “Tribe-Infecting Virus”’s effect, at which point the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus” is negated and “Tribe-Infecting Virus” is destroyed. Also, you cannot use “My Body as a Shield” against cards whose effects will not destroy a monster right away, so you cannot use “My Body as a Shield” against “Jigen Bakudan”, “Ekibyo Drakmord”, “Magical Hats”, “Steel Scorpion”, “Toon Monsters”, “Thunder Nyan Nyan”, “Gradius’ Option”, “Summoner of Illusions”, “Limiter Removal”, “Call of the Haunted”, “Premature Burial”, or “Autonomous Action Unit”.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “My Body as a Shield” against cards whose effects might or might not destroy a monster right away, such as “Earthshaker”, “Barrel Dragon”, “Acid Trap Hole”, or “Time Wizard”.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “My Body as a Shield” against monsters with continuous effects such as “Kotodama” .</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “My Body as a Shield” during the Damage Step, so you cannot use it against a “Man-Eater Bug” or “Cyber Jar” flipped by an attack, but you can use it when these monsters are Flip Summoned.</li>
  <li>“Judgment of Anubis” may be chained to “My Body as a Shield”.</li>

<p><em>(C) This card’s name is treated as “Umi”. (1) Reduce the Level of all WATER monsters in both players’ hands and on the field by 1. (2) All WATER monsters gain 200 ATK and DEF.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The (C) Condition cannot be negated, it applies in the Deck:
    <ul>
      <li>You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between “A Legendary Ocean” and  “Umi”, because this card’s name is treated as “Umi”. So you cannot have 3 copies of “Umi” and 3 copies of “A Legendary Ocean” in your Deck.</li>
      <li>The name of “A Legendary Ocean” is treated as “Umi” always and for all  purposes. If “Imperial Order” is active, the card name is still treated  as “Umi”. If the opponent activates “Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell” targeting “Umi”, you cannot activate “Umi” or “A Legendary Ocean” for  the rest of the Duel.</li>
      <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, you may activate “Tornado Wall”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER  Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4  monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show  your opponent.</li>
      <li>When the effect of “Cyber Jar” is activated and  “A Legendary Ocean” is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5  WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of “Cyber Jar”. This is because  the effect of “A Legendary Ocean” does not include Monster Cards in the  Deck.</li>
      <li>If “A Legendary Ocean” and “Gravity Bind” are active, you  may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If “A Legendary Ocean” is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay  occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.</li>
      <li>If “A Legendary Ocean” and “Infinite Dismissal” are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be  destroyed during the End Phase.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The (2) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    <ul>
      <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, “The Legendary Fisherman” on the field  is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus  or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your  hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.</li>
      <li>“A Legendary Ocean” does not have the effect of “Umi” that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

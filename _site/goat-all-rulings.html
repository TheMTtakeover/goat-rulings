<h2 id="card-rulings">Card Rulings</h2>

<h4 id="3-hump-lacooda">3-HUMP LACOODA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“3-Hump Lacooda”’s effect is an Ignition Effect.</li>
  <li>You don’t have to activate “3-Hump Lacooda”’s effect just because you have 3 copies in play.</li>
  <li>You can choose which of the “3-Hump Lacoodas”’ effects you are activating; it can be one of the ones you are Tributing or the one that is remaining on the field.</li>
  <li>Tributing 2 “3-Hump Lacoodas” is a cost.</li>
  <li>If your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” or “Book of Moon” to the activation of “3-Hump Lacooda”’s effect, the effect is not negated.</li>
  <li>If you Summon your third “3-Hump Lacooda”, you can activate its effect before your opponent activates “Torrential Tribute”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-starred-ladybug-of-doom">4-STARRED LADYBUG OF DOOM</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4-Starred Ladybug of Doom destroys monsters that are Level 4 at the time “4-Starred Ladybug of Doom” resolves.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="7">7</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have 3 “7”’s and destroy them all, you get 2100 Life Points.</li>
  <li>If your opponent also has “7”’s, they are also destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you have 3 “7”’s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain “Imperial Order” to negate the effect.</li>
  <li>Each effect of “7” that gives you 700 Life Points goes on a chain, so if multiple “7”’s are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the chain.</li>
  <li>If other cards are also sent to the Graveyard at the same time, like “Sangan” or “Black Pendant”, the card controlled by the turn player is Step 1.</li>
  <li>If your 3rd “7” is activated, but destroyed by “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain, you can’t activate its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its Graveyard effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="7-completed">7 COMPLETED</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The choice of increasing ATK or DEF on the equipped monster is determined when “7 Completed” is activated.</li>
  <li>If “7 Completed” is equipped to another legal target by “Fairy’s Hand Mirror,” the choice of increasing ATK or DEF by the effect of “7 completed” does not change.</li>
  <li>If “7 Completed” is equipped to another legal target by “Tailor of the Fickle,” the choice of increasing ATK or DEF by the effect of “7 Completed” does not change.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="8-claws-scorpion">8-CLAWS SCORPION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Even if “8-Claws Scorpion” is equipped with an Equip Spell Card, its ATK is 2400 when it attacks a face-down Defense Position monster.</li>
  <li>The effect of “8-Claws Scorpion” is a Trigger Effect that is applied if the condition is correct on activation (“8-Claws Scorpion” declared an attack against a face-down Defense Position monster.) The target monster does not have to be in face-down Defense Position when the effect of “8-Claws Scorpion” is resolved. So if “Final Attack Orders” is active, or “Ceasefire” flips the monster face-up, “8-Claws Scorpion” still gets its 2400 ATK.</li>
  <li>The ATK of “8-Claws Scorpion” becomes 2400 during damage calculation. You cannot chain “Rush Recklessly” or “Blast with Chain” to this effect. If these cards were activated before damage calculation, then the ATK of “8-Claws Scorpion” becomes 2400 during damage calculation so those cards have no effect on its ATK.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-cat-of-ill-omen">A CAT OF ILL OMEN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show the card to your opponent.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” &amp; “Necrovalley” are both active, and “A Cat of Ill Omen” is flipped, you add the card to your hand because “Necrovalley” is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.</li>
  <li>If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to the effect to destroy “Necrovalley”, so that “Necrovalley” is not on the field when this effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.</li>
  <li>You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” has been successfully placed in the Deck face-up, can the effect of “A Cat of Ill Omen” be used to place it on top of the Deck?<br />
A: Yes you can. The “Pharaoh’s Treasure” would be placed on top of your Deck. Its effect will activate when it is drawn. But if there is a “Necrovalley” face-up on the field, the “Pharaoh’s Treasure” would be added to your hand right away and would NOT activate its effect (because it isn’t drawn). Curtis Schultz, 04/07/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-deal-with-dark-ruler">A DEAL WITH DARK RULER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “Level” in “A Deal with Dark Ruler” is the original Level printed on the Monster Card.</li>
  <li>If your opponent’s Level 8 or higher monster than you control is sent to the Graveyard, you can activate “A Deal with Dark Ruler”.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “A Deal with Dark Ruler” during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>You can only Special Summon 1 monster with “A Deal with Dark Ruler”, but you can activate 2 copies of “A Deal with Dark Ruler” to Special Summon 1 “Berserk Dragon” for each, even if only 1 Level 8 or higher monster was sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can activate “A Deal with Dark Ruler” if your Level 8 or higher monster that is an Equip Spell Card is sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard (such as “Koitsu” or “Dark Necrofear” destroyed by “Heavy Storm”).</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“A Deal with Dark Ruler” may only be activated after a Level 8 or higher monster is sent to the Graveyard from your field.</li>
  <li>“A Deal with Dark Ruler” may not be activated in a chain with an effect that would send a Level 8 or higher monster to the Graveyard if a Level 8 or higher monster has not been sent to the Graveyard this turn.</li>
  <li>If the summon of a Level 8 or higher monster is negated, “A Deal with Dark Ruler” may not be activated for that monster.</li>
  <li>“A Deal with Dark Ruler” may be activated in the End Phase, or the Battle Phase, but cannot be activated in the Damage Step.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-feather-of-the-phoenix">A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can select the card you discarded for the cost of “A Feather of the Phoenix” to be the card returned to the top of your Deck. If you discarded “Night Assailant” or “Makyura the Destructor”, then their effects will activate.</li>
  <li>You can select a Fusion Monster in the Graveyard for “A Feather of the Phoenix” but it is returned to the Fusion Deck.</li>
  <li>Discarding 1 card is a cost to activate this effect. Your opponent can chain “Disappear” to the activation of this card and remove the discarded card from play so that you cannot return it to the top of the Deck.</li>
  <li>This is an effect that targets.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-feint-plan">A FEINT PLAN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “A Feint Plan” is activated and you control only face-down monsters, your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack your Life Points directly either.</li>
  <li>If you activate “A Feint Plan” after your opponent declares an attack against one of your face-down monsters, that attack resolves as normal, but they cannot attack other face-down monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is because “A Feint Plan” prevents declaring an attack against a face-down monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time “A Feint Plan” resolves during the Battle Step.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “A Feint Plan” is activated in response to an opponent’s declaration of an Attack on a face-down monster, that attack will resolve normally.</li>
  <li>If all of a player’s monsters are face-down in the turn that “A Feint Plan” is activated, the opponent may not attack directly, unless the attacking monster can inherently attack directly, such as “Inaba White Rabbit,” “Jinzo #7,” a monster equipped with “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal”, or Toons.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-hero-emerges">A HERO EMERGES</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can Special Summon a high-level monster, like “Dark Magician”, with “A Hero Emerges”. But if your opponent selects a Special Summon-only monster like “Dark Necrofear”, or a Spirit Monster, it is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When “Guardian Elma” is selected for “A Hero Emerges”, and you have “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” on your side of the field, you can Special Summon her, but if you don’t have it, then she is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can activate “A Hero Emerges” even if you have only 1 card in your hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This ruling addresses what happens if your opponent chooses the following monster card from your hand by the effect of “A Hero Emerges.”</li>
  <li>Special-Summon-only monster: sent to the Graveyard. (Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth, Exodia Necross, Dark Necrofear, Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End, all Ritual Monsters, etc.)</li>
  <li>Spirit Monster: sent to the Graveyard. (Yata-Garasu, Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi, Yamata Dragon, Tsukuyomi, etc.)</li>
  <li>Guardian Monster without appropriate Spell Card on the field: sent to the Graveyard. (Guardian Grarl, Guardian Ceal, Guardian Tryce, etc.)</li>
  <li>The effect of “A Hero Emerges” causes a replay.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-legendary-ocean">A LEGENDARY OCEAN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between “A Legendary Ocean” and “Umi”, because this card’s name is treated as “Umi”. So you cannot have 3 copies of “Umi” and 3 copies of “A Legendary Ocean” in your Deck.</li>
  <li>The name of “A Legendary Ocean” is treated as “Umi” always and for all purposes. If “Imperial Order” is active, the card name is still treated as “Umi”. If the opponent activates “Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell” targeting “Umi”, you cannot activate “Umi” or “A Legendary Ocean” for the rest of the Duel.</li>
  <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, you may activate “Tornado Wall”.</li>
  <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4 monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show your opponent.</li>
  <li>When “A Legendary Ocean” is active, “The Legendary Fisherman” on the field is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.</li>
  <li>When the effect of “Cyber Jar” is activated and “A Legendary Ocean” is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5 WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of “Cyber Jar”. This is because the effect of “A Legendary Ocean” does not include Monster Cards in the Deck.</li>
  <li>If “A Legendary Ocean” and “Gravity Bind” are active, you may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If “A Legendary Ocean” is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.</li>
  <li>If “A Legendary Ocean” and “Infinite Dismissal” are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be destroyed during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>“A Legendary Ocean” does not have the effect of “Umi” that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While “A Legendary Ocean” is on the field, Ritual Summons using WATER monsters as Tributes must take into account the reduced Star Level.</li>
  <li>Cards revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2” are not considered in the hand. The one star reduction given by “A Legendary Ocean” does not apply to monsters revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2’s” effect.</li>
  <li>If “Prohibition” has been activated and “Umi” has been declared, “A Legendary Ocean” may not be played.</li>
  <li>“A Legendary Ocean” is not a valid choice for the effect of “Prohibition.”</li>
  <li>While “The Legendary Fisherman” is face-up on the field and active while “A Legendary Ocean” is face up on the field, “The Legendary Fisherman” will be a 5 Star Monster as it is unaffected by Spell Cards, including “A Legendary Ocean.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-man-with-wdjat">A MAN WITH WDJAT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you Set “A Man with Wdjat”, its effect is not activated.</li>
  <li>Any effects of the card you look at are not activated when you look at them with “A Man with Wdjat” (such as a Flip Effect, or if it is a Trap Card, etc.).</li>
  <li>Netrep Rulings:</li>
  <li>If “A Man with Wdjat” is not Normal Summoned, none of its effect will apply. This includes the ‘during each of your following Standby Phases’ text.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-rival-appears">A RIVAL APPEARS!</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the effect of “A Rival Appears!”, refer to the levels of the monster on the field and the monster in the hand at the time “A Rival Appears!” resolves (for purposes of “Cost Down”, “Level Conversion Lab”, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain destroying “Demotion”, etc.)</li>
  <li>If the opponent’s monster is face-down or not on the field when “A Rival Appears!” resolves, then its effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you do not have a monster of the same level as the target, you cannot activate “A Rival Appears!”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-wingbeat-of-giant-dragon">A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monsters that are changed to Dragon-Type by an effect are eligible to be targeted by “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon.”</li>
  <li>Fusion monsters returned to the hand by the effect of “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” are returned to the Fusion Deck.</li>
  <li>If the only eligible Dragon-Type monster is removed from the field before “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” resolves, the effect of “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” disappears.</li>
  <li>“A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” targets the monster it returns to the hand. The ‘return one Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type’ is not a cost of activation.</li>
  <li>“A Wingbeat of a Giant Dragon” may not be activated while “Lord of D.” is active on the field.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abare-ushioni">ABARE USHIONI</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you call the coin toss wrong for “Abare Ushioni” you can still prevent the damage with “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, etc.</li>
  <li>You cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the effect of “Abare Ushioni” because you don’t know yet if you will take damage or not from the effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="absolute-end">ABSOLUTE END</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Absolute End” is activated during an attack, that attack becomes a direct attack.</li>
  <li>If “Taunt” and “Absolute End” are both active, the attack becomes a direct attack to your Life Points. This is because the attack target is the monster selected by “Taunt”, but then “Absolute End” turns it into a direct attack.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="absorbing-kid-from-the-sky">ABSORBING KID FROM THE SKY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Level is the original Level printed on the card.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abyssal-designator">ABYSSAL DESIGNATOR</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your opponent sends a monster to the Graveyard with the declared Type and Attribute, you cannot see their hand and Deck. But if they claim to have no such card, you can check their hand and Deck to confirm.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="acid-trap-hole">ACID TRAP HOLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A face-down “Jinzo” will be destroyed by this card.</li>
  <li>If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as “Enraged Muka Muka”, calculate the current DEF, then determine if it will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in your hand, “Enraged Muka Muka” would not be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected monster is 2000 or less, such as a “Hane-Hane”, it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Acid Trap Hole” is activated in a Chain, at what point does its target Flip Effect resolve? Is it immediately DURING the Chain or immediately AFTER the Chain?<br />
A: After the chain. bishop, 01/28/2004</li>
  <li>Q: What happens if I activate “Acid Trap Hole” in the Battle Step of a Battle Phase? Would I resolve the Flip Effect in the damage step? Could I Chain to the Flip Effect in this case?<br />
A: The Flip Effect would start a new Chain in the Battle Step. You can respond to it with appropriate card effects. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="adhesion-trap-hole">ADHESION TRAP HOLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Adhesion Trap Hole” works against “a monster or monsters”, so “Adhesion Trap Hole” does NOT target.</li>
  <li>When “Cyber Jar” is activated, you may use “Adhesion Trap Hole” against all monsters your opponent Special Summons in face-up Attack Position, but “Adhesion Trap Hole” has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons face-down.</li>
  <li>“Adhesion Trap Hole” cannot affect monsters Special Summoned face-down with “The Shallow Grave”, “Morphing Jar #2”, etc.</li>
  <li>If a monster affected by “Adhesion Trap Hole” is flipped face-down (with “Book of Moon”, etc.), “Adhesion Trap Hole”’s effect disappears and the monster’s ATK is back to normal.</li>
  <li>“Adhesion Trap Hole” halves the original ATK, so if you activate another effect that alters ATK, halve the original ATK first and then resolve the other ATK-modifying effect.</li>
  <li>If a monster affected by “Adhesion Trap Hole” is then equipped with “Megamorph”, only “Megamorph”’s effect applies.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="after-the-struggle-fka-after-genocide">AFTER THE STRUGGLE (f.k.a. AFTER GENOCIDE)</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card’s title has been changed to “After the Struggle”. If you have a card titled “After Genocide” its name is treated as “After the Struggle”.</li>
  <li>Even if the Battle Damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of “Waboku”, “Kuriboh”, “Sanga of the Thunder”, etc., both the attacking and defending monster are still destroyed during the End Step by this card’s effect.</li>
  <li>If you activate “After the Struggle”, even a monster that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect during the End Step.</li>
  <li>Note that “After the Struggle” will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monsters that have had their attacks negated are not destroyed by the effect of “After the Struggle.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="agido">AGIDO</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Agido” can Special Summon itself.</li>
  <li>“Agido”’s effect does not target.</li>
  <li>While “Necrovalley” is active, the effect of “Agido” will activate, but will be negated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="airknight-parshath">AIRKNIGHT PARSHATH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drawing a card is not optional. You must draw 1 card any time “Airknight Parshath” inflicts Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points. This includes direct attacks, and when it battles with a monster with a lower ATK or DEF.</li>
  <li>If the opponent activates “Waboku” or “Kuriboh” to reduce the Battle Damage to 0, you do not draw.</li>
  <li>When “Airknight Parshath” attacks a face-down monster with a Flip Effect and inflicts Battle Damage, you draw 1 card before the Flip Effect is applied.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="altar-for-tribute">ALTAR FOR TRIBUTE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sending a monster to the Graveyard for “Altar for Tribute” is a cost.</li>
  <li>You can select a Token Monster as the cost for “Altar for Tribute”, but you won’t gain any Life Points because Tokens are taken off the field instead of going to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can send your opponent’s monster that you control to the Graveyard as the cost for “Altar for Tribute”, and you would gain the Life Points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Altar for Tribute” does not Tribute the card it affects.</li>
  <li>“Altar for Tribute” does not destroy the card it affects.</li>
  <li>Tokens chosen as the Tribute for “Altar for Tribute” will not increase a player’s Life Points as the Token will not go to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>Sending a monster to the Graveyard is an activation cost for “Altar for Tribute.”</li>
  <li>If “Banisher of the Light” is active on the field when “Altar for Tribute” resolves, the player who activates “Altar for Tribute” will not gain Life Points as the monster does not go to the Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="amazoness-archers">AMAZONESS ARCHERS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“These monsters” means all of your opponent’s face-up monsters on the field at the time “Amazoness Archers” resolves, not just the monsters that were flipped by “Amazoness Archers”’ effect.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Amazoness Archers” during the Battle Phase and your opponent Special Summons another monster afterwards (such as with “Call of the Haunted”, or if “Cyber Jar” is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not affected by “Amazoness Archers” and does not suffer the -500 ATK reduction nor does it have to attack.</li>
  <li>The -500 ATK applies to each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You can activate multiple “Amazoness Archers” and the ATK reductions are cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies).</li>
  <li>“Amazoness Archers” vs. “Cat’s Ear Tribe”: the ATK is 200.</li>
  <li>If “Fushioh Richie” or “Otohime” are flipped face-up by “Amazoness Archers’ effect, their effects are activated because their effects are not Flip Effects; their effects begin a new chain that resolves after the current chain.</li>
  <li>If a face-down “Jinzo” is flipped by “Amazoness Archers”, “Amazoness Archers”’ effect is not negated.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Amazoness Archers” will make your opponent have to attack with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the field. If “Amazoness Archers” is in effect, and later a replay occurs, your opponent cannot choose not to attack.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have already attacked cannot attack again. If “The Dark Door” is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot attack still cannot attack (Toon Monsters the turn they are Summoned, “Ultimate Obedient Fiend” under the wrong conditions, etc.) If “Diffusion Wave-Motion” is in effect, only the monster affected by “Diffusion Wave-Motion” can attack. The ATK reduction of “Amazoness Archers” is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Amazoness Archers” and chain “Magic Cylinder”, “Magic Cylinder” does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your opponent’s other monsters must attack normally. If you chain “Amazoness Archers” to “Magic Cylinder”, the ATK is reduced first and then “Magic Cylinder” does damage.</li>
  <li>If either player chains “Negate Attack” to “Amazoness Archers”, the Battle Phase ends because of “Negate Attack”’s effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If you control 2 “Jinzos” and only 1 is equipped with “Amplifier”, you cannot activate Trap Cards.</li>

  <li>If the controller of “Jinzo” with “Amplifier” has activated the effects of “Regulation of Tribe”, “Spatial Collapse”, “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Robbin’ Zombie”, “Curse of Darkness”, etc., their effects are not negated, but if the opponent activates them, they ARE negated.</li>
  <li>If your “Amplifier” is switched from your “Jinzo” to your opponent’s “Jinzo” with “Tailor of the Fickle”, then your Jinzo is not destroyed.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate a card that would cause an infinite loop because its effect cannot resolve completely. Example #1: You activate “Snatch Steal” targeting your opponent’s “Jinzo”. You then equip “Jinzo” with “Amplifier”. You cannot activate “Imperial Order” because it cannot resolve completely (it would negate “Snatch Steal”, returning “Jinzo” to your opponent, which would negate “Imperial Order” so “Snatch Steal” would re-activate). If you activate “Imperial Order” by mistake in such a situation, flip it face-down again. Example #2: you control “Jinzo” equipped with “Amplifier” and “Skill Drain”. Your opponent cannot activate “Royal Decree”.</li>

  <li>You get to Special Summon a new monster when “Apprentice Magician” is destroyed as a result of battle, even if “Banisher of the Light” is in play.</li>

  <li>You must show your opponent the monster you Special Summon.</li>
  <li>For effects that place a Spell Counter, you can chain to the activation of those effects. The Spell Counter is actually placed when the effect resolves.</li>

  <li>Other Rulings:</li>
  <li>An active “Skill Drain” can negate the effects of the “D.D. Warrior Lady,” “D.D.

<ul>
  <li>“Asura Priest” may attack directly if it has not already attacked a monster this turn.</li>

  <li>If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.</li>

  <li>Since “Axe of Despair” activates in the Graveyard, you can Tribute a monster to return it to the top of your Deck even if “Imperial Order” is on the field.</li>

  <li>If you have 4 Effect Monsters and 1 Normal Monster with 1500 ATK in your Graveyard, you can activate this card and return the 1 Normal Monster to your hand.</li>
  <li>If you have 5 Normal Monsters in your Graveyard, you can activate “Backup Soldier” and chain a second “Backup Soldier” before the first resolves, because the 5 monster requirement only needs to be fulfilled at activation.

  <li>If your opponent activates “Delinquent Duo” and you chain “Backup Soldier” with 2 pieces of Exodia and retrieve the other 3 from your Graveyard you win the Duel before you have to discard for “Delinquent Duo”. This is because you check for victory conditions in between steps in a chain, (but not in between two separate effects of a single card like “Graceful Charity”).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bad-reaction-to-simochi">BAD REACTION TO SIMOCHI</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<h4 id="bait-doll">BAIT DOLL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you use this card on a Trap Card that was just Set this turn, the timing is incorrect so the Trap is destroyed.

If they cannot pay the costs, the Trap Card is negated and destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Bait Doll” is activated and targets an “Imperial Order” the opponent may chain the “Imperial Order” which will negate the effect of “Bait Doll” and it will not be returned to your Deck. Or the opponent can allow “Bait Doll” to force the activation of “Imperial Order”, and “Bait Doll” will be shuffled into the Deck and “Imperial Order” will remain active on the field because the timing of its activation was legitimate.</li>
  <li>If “Bait Doll” is activated and targets “Magic Jammer”, “Magic Drain”, etc. the opponent may chain the Trap Card to negate and destroy “Bait Doll”.

  <li>If “Jinzo” is face-up on the field and the effect of “Bait Doll” forces the activation of a Normal or Counter Trap Card, that Trap Card’s effect is negated and the Trap Card is destroyed.

  <li>If the target of “Bait Doll” is no longer on the field (if it was sent to the Graveyard with “Emergency Provisions”, or destroyed by “Mystical Space Typhoon”, as a chain to the activation of “Bait Doll”), then “Bait Doll” is still shuffled back into the Deck. As long as the activation and effect of “Bait Doll” are not negated, the effect of “Bait Doll” that shuffles it back into the Deck still resolves.</li>
  <li>If “Chain Burst” is active on the field and you use “Bait Doll” to activate the opponent’s Trap Card, and its timing is correct, the opponent takes the 1000 points of damage.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card targets your opponent’s monster that is battling your Fiend-Type monster.</li>
  <li>Paying Life Points for this card is a cost.</li>
  <li>You cannot pay more Life Points than necessary. This means that if the target monster has ATK 1500 / DEF 1800, the highest amount of Life Points you can pay is 1800. The target monster will then be an ATK 0 / DEF 0. If the target monster has ATK 1850 / DEF 500, the most you can pay is 1800. This is because you have to play in multiples of 100, and paying 1900 would be paying more than necessary. So you may pay 1800 Life Points and the target monster would become an ATK 50 / DEF 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Barrel Behind the Door” can only be activated against an effect that inflicts damage to YOUR Life Points.</li>
  <li>“Barrel Behind the Door” can only be activated against DAMAGE. It cannot be activated against costs like “Imperial Order” or “Wall of Revealing Light”. It cannot be activated against effects that cause you to lose Life Points like “The Immortal of Thunder”. It cannot be activated against effects that switch damage, like another “Barrel Behind the Door”, because they do not inflict damage, they simply transfer it.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against a Continuous Spell or Trap Card, an Equip Spell Card, or a Field Spell Card. So you cannot activate it against “Magical Thorn”, “Dark Snake Syndrome”, “Wave-Motion Cannon”, or “Black Pendant”.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against a Continuous Effect Monster like “Gravekeeper’s Vassal” or “Fire Princess” (even if an effect like “Gift of the Mystical Elf” is activated while “Fire Princess” is on the field).</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against Normal and Quick-Play Spell and Trap Cards, such as “Tremendous Fire” or “Attack and Receive”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against Trigger Effects like “Lava Golem”, “Giant Germ”, “Relinquished” (when it inflicts effect damage, since “Barrel Behind the Door” can be activated during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap Card), “Minar” (when discarded), “Parasite Paracide” (when it inflicts effect damage), “Bowganian”, “Mushroom Man #2”, “Reflect Bounder” (when it is attacked), “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” (when it attacks and destroys a Defense Position monster and sends it to the Graveyard), “Granadora” (when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard), “Balloon Lizard” (when destroyed), “KA-2 Des Scissors”, “Needle Burrower”, “Atomic Firefly”, “Elephant Statue of Disaster”, and “Ameba”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against Ignition Effects like “Cannon Soldier”, “Catapult Turtle”, “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”, and “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against Flip Effects like “Princess of Tsurugi”, “Fire Sorcerer”, “Needle Ball”, “Des Koala”, and “Lady Assailant of Flames”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against “Jigen Bakudan”. You don’t activate “Barrel Behind the Door” when the Flip Effect activates, you activate “Barrel Behind the Door” when “Jigen Bakudan” activates its effect during the next Standby Phase to inflict damage.</li>
  <li>“Barrel Behind the Door” cannot be activated against cards that do not inflict damage when the card resolves, such as “Graverobber”, which inflicts damage later.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against “Ring of Destruction”, and then your opponent will take all of the damage (the damage inflicted to him and the damage that would have been inflicted to you). The same is true for “Tremendous Fire”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against “Magic Cylinder”. The attack will be negated and the damage transferred to the opponent.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against effects if you don’t know for certain that they will inflict damage when the effect is activated. So you cannot activate it against “Dice Jar”, “Judgment of Anubis”, “Time Wizard” or “Ante”. Your cannot activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against “Ceasefire” if all monsters on the field are face-down, or if all monsters on the field are face-up Normal Monsters, but you can activate it against “Ceasefire” if there is at least 1 face-up Effect Monster on the field.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” during the Damage Step against appropriate effects, such as “Princess of Tsurugi”, because it is a Counter-Trap.</li>
  <li>Remember that the effects that Counter-Traps are chained to must immediately precede them in the chain. So if you activate “Ring of Destruction”, and intend to chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to it, if your opponent chains something in-between (even an unrelated effect like “Jar of Greed”), then you cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” because “Ring of Destruction” is no longer the preceding step in the chain.</li>
  <li>If one player’s “Giant Germ” attacks another “Giant Germ” so that both effects activating during the Damage Step, they form a chain. If both players control “Barrel Behind the Door, only 1 player can chain theirs. The turn player will be able to chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the opponent’s “Giant Germ” because it is Step 2 of the chain.</li>
  <li>If “Bad Reaction to Simochi” is active, you can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against effects that would normally cause a Life Point increase, because they inflict damage instead.</li>
  <li>If you re-direct damage to your opponent using “Barrel Behind the Door”, and you have “Dark Room of Nightmare” on the field, then “Dark Room of Nightmare” inflicts 300 more damage.</li>
  <li>For effects like “Princess of Tsurugi” “Thunder Crash”, and “Restructer Revolution”, where damage is added up, “Barrel Behind the Door” re-directs the entire sum of damage.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="batteryman-c">BATTERYMAN C</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have 2 “Batterymen C” on the field in Attack Position, each of your Machines gains +1000 ATK. If you have 3 “Battermen C” on the field in Attack Position, each of your Machines gains +1500 ATK. (NOT +4500!!!)</li>
  <li>A “Batteryman C” equipped to “Relinquished” is not in Attack or Defense Position so it will not be counted for the effect of “Batteryman C”.</li>
  <li>If “Batteryman C” is changed to Machine-Type, it will itself gain the ATK bonus.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="battle-scarred">BATTLE-SCARRED</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the Archfiend targeted by “Battle-Scarred” is flipped face-down, then the effect of “Battle-Scarred” disappears and “Battle-Scarred” remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>You can select an Archfiend that doesn’t require you to pay Life Points as a target for “Battle-Scarred” (such as “Summoned Skull”, “Archfiend Soldier”, or “Fiend Skull Dragon”).</li>
  <li>When your opponent takes control of your Archfiend targeted by “Battle-Scarred”, then your opponent must pay the cost for the Archfiend, and then pay the cost again because of “Battle-Scarred”.</li>
  <li>When an Archfiend is equipped with “Heart of Clear Water”, it is not destroyed if it was targeted by “Battle-Scarred” and “Battle-Scarred” is removed from the field.</li>
  <li>If your opponent doesn’t have enough Life Points to pay for “Battle-Scarred”, nothing happens to your opponent, you must still pay for the cost of your Archfiend, and “Battle-Scarred” remains on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Battle-Scarred” and “Pandemonium” are both active, neither player has to pay for Archfiend costs or for “Battle-Scarred”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bazoo-the-soul-eater">BAZOO THE SOUL-EATER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you remove Monster Cards from your Graveyard to increase the ATK of “Bazoo the Soul-Eater”, then on your opponent’s turn he uses “Change of Heart” to gain control of the same “Bazoo the Soul-Eater”, your opponent can remove cards from his Graveyard to further increase the ATK. The ATK increase you caused will end during that End Phase, and the ATK increase your opponent caused will end during your End Phase.</li>
  <li>Removing Monster Cards from the Graveyard is a cost of “Bazoo the Soul-Eater”’s effect, so if your opponent chains to the activation of this effect with “Call of the Haunted”, to Special Summon “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer”, the effect of “Bazoo the Soul-Eater” is not negated since the Monster Cards were already removed.</li>

  <li>You can use “Beast Soul Swap” to return a non-Beast-Type monster on the field that has been changed to Beast-Type with “DNA Surgery”.</li>
  <li>This card targets the 1 face-up Beast-Type monster you returned to the hand.</li>

<h4 id="beckoning-light">BECKONING LIGHT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discarding is not a cost.</li>
  <li>“Beckoning Light” doesn’t target.</li>
  <li>When you resolve “Beckoning Light”, first discard, then pick cards to add to your hand. So you can add cards to your hand that you discarded while resolving “Beckoning Light”.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have enough LIGHT monsters as there are cards in your hand, you cannot activate “Beckoning Light”.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Beckoning Light” if you have no cards in your hand.</li>
  <li>If your opponent chains “Disappear” to “Beckoning Light”, and there are no longer enough LIGHT monsters to retrieve as there were cards in your hand, the effect of “Beckoning Light” disappears and you don’t discard your hand or add cards to your hand.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="begone-knave">BEGONE, KNAVE!</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Gemini Elf” attacks a Defense Position “Battle Footballer”, and “Gemini Elf”’s controller takes 200 damage, then “Begone, Knave!”’s effect will send “Battle Footballer” back to its owner’s hand.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Begone, Knave!” can be on a chain.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Begone, Knave!” is applied to the monster that inflicts Battle Damage to the player, so if “Amazoness Swords Woman” battles a stronger monster, “Amazoness Swords Woman” would normally be returned to the owner’s hand, but because she is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, she will not be returned.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="behemoth-the-king-of-all-animals">BEHEMOTH THE KING OF ALL ANIMALS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is possible to “properly” Tribute Summon “Behemoth the King of All Animals” with just 1 Tribute. For example, you can Tribute Summon it with “Trojan Horse”, or use “Cost Down” and then Tribute 1 monster because “Behemoth the King of All Animals” is only Level 5. In cases such as this, either 2000 ATK or 2700 ATK is correct, so the controller can select which ATK it will have.</li>
  <li>If “Trojan Horse” is Tributed to Tribute Summon “Behemoth the King of All Animals”, you still only return 1 monster from the Graveyard to your hand, because it’s the same number as the number of monsters you Tributed to perform the Summon.</li>
  <li>If “Behemoth the King of All Animals” is Tribute Summoned with 2000 ATK, and is then flipped face-down or removed from play temporarily, its ATK becomes 2700 points when it is again face-up on the field.</li>
  <li>If you Tribute Summon “Behemoth the King of All Animals” with 1 Tribute, and “Skill Drain” is activated, its ATK becomes 2700 points. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed, the ATK remains at 2700 points.</li>
  <li>If you Tribute Set “Behemoth the King of All Animals” with 1 Tribute, its ATK will only be 2000 points when flipped face-up. However, once it is face-up, if it is flipped face-down again, the effect is reset and its ATK becomes 2700 points.</li>
  <li>The second effect of “Behemoth the King of All Animals” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to. It is a targeting effect that targets a monster(s) in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If you have “Behemoth the King of All Animals” with an original ATK of 2000 because you Summoned or Set him with 1 Tribute, and you equip it with “Megamorph”, its original ATK will be 4000 when your Life Points are lower, and 1000 when your Life Points are higher.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="berserk-dragon">BERSERK DRAGON</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Berserk Dragon” cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of “A Deal with Dark Ruler”. So “Berserk Dragon” cannot be Special Summoned with “Monster Reborn”, etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.</li>
  <li>If “Berserk Dragon” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, you cannot try to resolve “Berserk Dragon”’s effect before it returns to play; you must return it to play first and then it loses 500 ATK.</li>
  <li>While “Skill Drain” is active, “Berserk Dragon”’s effects are negated. But “Berserk Dragon”’s effect doesn’t count turns, so if “Skill Drain” was active for 4 turns, and is then destroyed, do not reduce “Berserk Dragon”’s ATK for those 4 turns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Berserk Dragon” is flipped face down, when it is turned face up again, it will have its original ATK value of 3500.</li>
  <li>If “Berserk Dragon” temporarily leaves the field, when it returns, it will have its original ATK value of 3500.</li>
  <li>If “Berserk Dragon” attacks Life Points directly, it may not attack any monsters that may later be on the field.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="berserk-gorilla">BERSERK GORILLA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a face-down “Berserk Gorilla” is attacked and flipped face-up, it’s destroyed after damage calculation.</li>
  <li>If a face-down “Berserk Gorilla” is flipped face-up by “Swords of Revealing Light”, it’s destroyed after resolving “Swords of Revealing Light”.</li>
  <li>“Berserk Gorilla” cannot attack if “Swords of Revealing Light”, multiple “Marauding Captains”, etc. are in play.</li>
  <li>If “Stumbling” and “Final Attack Orders” are both in play, and “Berserk Gorilla” is Summoned, “Berserk Gorilla” is destroyed when it is changed to Defense Position by “Stumbling”.</li>
  <li>If “Final Attack Orders” and “Berserk Gorilla” are both on the field, and the opponent targets “Berserk Gorilla” with “Ring of Destruction”, and you chain “Zero Gravity”, “Berserk Gorilla” is destroyed in the middle of the chain due to “Zero Gravity”’s effect, and “Ring of Destruction”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you control “Berserk Gorilla” and another monster, “Berserk Gorilla” doesn’t have to be the first monster you attack with, you can attack with other monsters first, as long as you do attack with “Berserk Gorilla”.</li>
  <li>If “The Dark Door” is active and you control “Berserk Gorilla” and another monster, you can choose for your other monster to be the 1 monster that attacks.</li>
  <li>If you control “Berserk Gorilla” you must enter your Battle Phase, even if “Gravity Bind” is active on the field, preventing it from attacking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Berserk Gorilla” is a continuous effect.</li>

<h4 id="big-bang-shot">BIG BANG SHOT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the monster equipped with “Big Bang Shot” is destroyed, and “Big Bang Shot” is destroyed as a result of this, the equipped monster is not removed from play.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Big Bang Shot” that removes the equipped monster from play can be resolved between steps of a chain. For example, if “Change of Heart” targets a monster equipped with “Big Bang Shot”, and “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to “Change of Heart” to destroy “Big Bang Shot”, first resolve “Mystical Space Typhoon” and destroy “Big Bang Shot”, then remove the monster that was equipped from play, and THEN resolve “Change of Heart” (and the effect of “Change of Heart” disappears).</li>
  <li>If a monster equipped with “Big Bang Shot” is flipped face-down, it is no longer a target of “Big Bang Shot” so “Big Bang Shot” is sent to the Graveyard and the monster is not removed from play.</li>
  <li>When “Imperial Order” is active, and you destroy “Big Bang Shot” with “Dust Tornado”, the effect of “Big Bang Shot” that would remove the monster from play is NOT applied.</li>
  <li>When you send “Big Bang Shot” to the Graveyard with “Emergency Provisions”, the monster is removed from play at the same time.</li>
  <li>When equipped to “Guardian Ceal”, if you send “Big Bang Shot” to the Graveyard as a cost for “Guardian Ceal”’s effect, “Guardian Ceal” is removed from play but “Guardian Ceal”’s effect still resolves.</li>
  <li>If a monster is equipped with “Big Bang Shot” and “Fiber Jar” is activated, both “Big Bang Shot” and the equipped monster are shuffled into the Deck, and the equipped monster is not removed from play even though “Big Bang Shot” was removed from the field.</li>
  <li>If you equip your “Big Bang Shot” to your opponent’s “Dark Magician”, and “Dark Magician” attacks your “Giant Soldier of Stone”, the opponent of the owner of the “Big Bang Shot” takes the damage (so your opponent, who attacked with “Dark Magician”, takes 900 points of damage.)</li>
  <li>The battle damage caused when the equipped monster attacks a Defense Position monster is considered to come from the equipped monster, not from “Big Bang Shot”. So a “Don Zaloog” equipped with “Big Bang Shot” could still make the opponent discard 1 card when attacking a face-down monster with low DEF.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon a monster with “Premature Burial”, and equip it with “Big Bang Shot”, and “Heavy Storm” is activated, the effects of “Premature Burial” and “Big Bang Shot” form a chain, with the controller of the 2 cards determining the order in which they are placed on the chain, and the order in which they are resolved. If the controller chooses “Big Bang Shot” to be Step 2, then the monster will be removed from play. If the controller chooses “Premature Burial” to be Step 2, then the monster will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="big-burn">BIG BURN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can only activate “Big Burn” when an EFFECT that removes monsters in the Graveyard is activated. So you can’t activate “Big Burn” when a player removes monsters in the Graveyard as a COST to Special Summon “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning”, “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, or to activate the effect of “Strike Ninja” or “Freed the Brave Wanderer”. Nor can you use “Big Burn” when monsters are removed for a condition.</li>
  <li>“Big Burn”’s effect is negated if “Necrovalley” is active.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Big Burn” to effects like “Disappear”, “The Shallow Grave”, or “Spear Cretin”.</li>
  <li>You can’t activate “Big Burn” when “Sinister Serpent” activates in the Graveyard, because “Sinister Serpent” doesn’t target.</li>
  <li>When “Spirit Elimination” is activated and “Big Burn” is chained, the player who activated “Spirit Elimination” removes all monsters on his side of the field. The other player removes all monsters in the Graveyard as usual.</li>

<h4 id="big-shield-gardna">BIG SHIELD GARDNA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A face-down “Big Shield Gardna” can only negate a Spell Card that targets 1 face-down monster, so it cannot negate “Riryoku”, “Creature Swap” or “Dark Hole”, but could negate “Nobleman of Crossout” or “Tribute to the Doomed”.</li>
  <li>If “Big Shield Gardna” is targeted with a Spell Card, you may chain “Book of Moon” to flip it face-down, then it can negate the Spell Card and will flip back to face-up Defense Position.</li>
  <li>“Skill Drain” only negates the effects of monsters that are face-up on the field, so a face-down “Big Shield Gardna” may still negate a Spell Card that targets it while “Skill Drain” is active on the field. It will still be flipped to face-up Defense Position, and now its effect that changes its battle position when it is attacked will be negated.</li>
  <li>If “Prickle Fairy” attacks a face-down “Big Shield Gardna” both their effects will occur at the end of the Damage Step. “Prickle Fairy” will be Step 1 and “Big Shield Gardna” Step 2. So it will change to Attack Position, and then the effect of “Prickle Fairy” will change it back to Defense Position.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="big-wave-small-wave">BIG WAVE SMALL WAVE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can Special Summon high-level WATER monsters with “Big Wave Small Wave”, like “Levia-Dragon - Daedalus”, “Suijin”, or “Gogiga Gagagigo”.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Big Wave Small Wave” to Summon “Special Summon-only” WATER monsters like “Aqua Spirit” or “Fenrir”.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Big Wave Small Wave” when there are no WATER monsters on your side of the field.</li>
  <li>“The Legendary Fisherman” is not destroyed by the effect of “Big Wave Small Wave” if “Umi” is on the field, so he remains on the field.</li>

<h4 id="big-tusked-mammoth">BIG-TUSKED MAMMOTH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Big-Tusked Mammoth” includes those monsters Summoned this turn before “Big-Tusked Mammoth” was face-up on the field. For example, if your opponent attacks with a monster that was Summoned this turn, and you activate “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Big-Tusked Mammoth” from the Graveyard, this causes a replay, and your opponent now cannot attack with the monster that was Summoned this turn.</li>
  <li>If “Big-Tusked Mammoth” is Set on the field, and is attacked by a monster that was Summoned this turn, the attack resolves normally.</li>
  <li>Monsters flipped face-up with an effect like “Book of Taiyou” are not affected by “Big-Tusked Mammoth” and can attack that turn.</li>
  <li>If “Big-Tusked Mammoth” is on the field, and a monster that was Summoned this turn is removed from play temporarily and returns to the field the same turn, it still cannot attack.</li>

<h4 id="black-luster-soldier---envoy-of-the-beginning">BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER - ENVOY OF THE BEGINNING</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” is treated as a different card from “Black Luster Soldier”. So you can have 3 copies of “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” and 3 copies of “Black Luster Soldier” in your Deck &amp; Side Deck combined.</li>
  <li>“Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” can remove itself from play using its first effect.</li>
  <li>The first effect of “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” can be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2. The second effect can be activated during your Damage Step in your Battle Phase, and can be chained to.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning”’s first effect, and “Skill Drain” is chained to it to negate the effect, or if “Skill Drain” was active before you activated the effect, you cannot attack with “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” that turn because the activation of the effect was not negated and the condition that is included will not be negated by “Skill Drain”.</li>
  <li>If you use the first effect of “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning”, then remove him from play and return him to play, or destroy him and Special Summon him again, or flip him face-down then face-up again, you can activate his effect again that same turn.</li>
  <li>If “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” attacks, and its attack is negated by “Magic Cylinder” or “Negate Attack”, you cannot activate his first effect during Main Phase 2.</li>
  <li>When a card is removed from play by “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning”’s first effect, it is removed from play face-up.</li>
  <li>If “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” destroys your opponent’s only monster with his first attack, he can attack your opponent directly for the second attack.</li>
  <li>If “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” attacks and destroys your opponent’s monster, then attacks a second time and destroys another monster, it does not get to attack any more that turn.</li>
  <li>Even if you equip him with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce”, “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” only gets a maximum of 2 attacks.</li>
  <li>When “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” conducts a second attack using his second effect, his effect activates during the first attack’s Damage Step, and the attack is declared in the next Battle Step. The second attack must come consecutively after the first attack; other monsters’ attacks cannot come in-between.</li>

<h4 id="black-tyranno">BLACK TYRANNO</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="blade-knight">BLADE KNIGHT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you control “Blade Knight” and a face-down monster on your side of the field, “Blade Knight”’s second effect is not applied because you control another monster (whether it is face-up or face-down is not important).</li>
  <li>If you have two “Blade Knights”, then their second effects are not applied because for each one, you have another monster on the field besides the “Blade Knight”.</li>
  <li>If “Blade Knight” destroys a Flip Effect Monster like “Slate Warrior”, even that monster’s non-Flip effects are negated. So in this case, “Slate Warrior” does not reduce the ATK and DEF of the “Blade Knight” that destroyed it, because “Blade Knight” negates its effect.</li>
  <li>If “Blade Knight” destroys “The Immortal of Thunder”, its effect is negated. If your opponent had already gained the 3000 Life Points, then your opponent does not lose the 5000 Life Points. If “Blade Knight” attacked “The Immortal of Thunder” while it was face-down, your opponent neither gains nor loses Life Points from “The Immortal of Thunder”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If “Blade Knight” destroys “Spear Cretin”, “Spear Cretin”’s effect is not applied.</li>
  <li>The effect of a Flip Effect monster destroyed by “Blade Knight” is negated while the destroyed card is in the Graveyard. If the monster is Set again on the field, then the Flip Effect is activated when it’s flipped again.</li>

  <li>Monsters like “Tyrant Dragon” cannot negate the effect of “Blast Held by a Tribute”.</li>
  <li>In order to inflict 1000 points of damage to your opponent, you must destroy all monsters on your opponent’s side of the field first. So if you activate “Blast Held by a Tribute”, and your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” so that your opponent has no monsters to destroy, then “Blast Held by a Tribute” inflicts no damage.</li>

  <li>When you activate “Book of Moon” during the Battle Step to flip an attacking monster into face-down Defense Position, the attack stops. No replay is triggered. The attacking monster cannot change its battle position in Main Phase 2, because it is still considered to have declared an attack. (So it cannot be Flip Summoned in Main Phase 2.)</li>
  <li>If you are attacking, and you chain “Book of Moon” to your opponent’s “Mirror Force” to flip one of your monsters face-down, that monster is not destroyed by “Mirror Force”.</li>

<h4 id="bottomless-trap-hole">BOTTOMLESS TRAP HOLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card can remove from play multiple monsters at once, if they are Summoned simultaneously. Since this card can affect multiple monsters, it does not target.</li>
  <li>If the opponent has “Lord of D.” on the field and activates “The Flute of Summoning Dragon” to Special Summon 2 copies of “Blue-Eyes White Dragon”, you can activate this card and both will be removed from play. “Lord of D.” does not protect the Dragons because “Bottomless Trap Hole” does not target. The same situation would occur if only 1 “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” was Special Summoned, “Bottomless Trap Hole” still does not target.</li>
  <li>This card can only be activated when the last thing that resolved in the Duel was the opponent Normal/Flip/Special Summoning a monster(s). It cannot be activated at any other time.</li>
  <li>If “Cyber Jar” is flipped during a Main Phase, and the opponent Special Summons “Dark Blade”, “Luster Dragon”, “Magical Scientist” and a face-down monster, you can activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” and both “Luster Dragon” and “Dark Blade” will be removed from play. The “Magical Scientist”, face-down monster, and all monsters you Summoned will remain on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Cyber Jar” is flipped as a result of being attacked, you cannot activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” because it cannot be activated during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>If the opponent Summons a monster, then you activate “Bottomless Trap Hole”, and the opponent chains “Book of Moon” to flip the Summoned monster face-down, it is not removed from play by the effect of “Bottomless Trap Hole”.</li>
  <li>Use the current ATK at time of Summoning to determine if you can activate “Bottomless Trap Hole”. So if the opponent Tribute Summons “Enraged Muka Muka” with 1 card in their hand, you can activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” (since its ATK is 1600).</li>
  <li>You cannot activate this card after “Jinzo” is Summoned.</li>
  <li>You can activate this card after a monster was Special Summoned by the effect of another card, such as “Monster Reborn”.</li>
  <li>If the opponent activates “Monster Reborn” and then chains “Call of the Haunted” (so that 2 monsters are Summoned in the same chain), and then you activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” after that chain resolves only the monster Summoned by chain link 1 (“Monster Reborn”) is removed from play.</li>
  <li>If the opponent Normal Summons “Dark Blade”, then you activate “Bottomless Trap Hole”, and the opponent chains “Ultimate Offering” and Tributes “Dark Blade” to Tribute Summon “Summoned Skull”, the chain will resolve like this. “Dark Blade” is sent to the Graveyard and “Summoned Skull” is successfully Summoned, then “Bottomless Trap Hole” resolves and removes “Summoned Skull” from play.</li>

<h4 id="breaker-the-magical-warrior">BREAKER THE MAGICAL WARRIOR</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Placing a Spell Counter on “Breaker, the Magical Warrior” is a chain that begins after it is Summoned. If your opponent chains “Trap Hole” or “Ring of Destruction” to the placement of a Spell Counter on “Breaker, the Magical Warrior”, “Trap Hole” / “Ring of Destruction” resolves before the Spell Counter is placed on “Breaker, the Magical Warrior”, so you cannot chain “Breaker, the Magical Warrior”’s effect.</li>
  <li>“Breaker, the Magical Warrior”’s effect is Spell Speed 1 so you cannot chain it to the activation of a Spell Card.</li>
  <li>You can use “Breaker, the Magical Warrior”’s effect multiple times in the same turn as long as you can keep re-supplying him with Spell Counters (using “Pitch-Black Power Stone”, etc.).</li>
  <li>Removing a Spell Counter is a cost; if you remove a Spell Counter from “Breaker, the Magical Warrior” and your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction”, the Spell Counter has already been removed so “Ring of Destruction” deals 1600 damage to each player; “Breaker, the Magical Warrior”’s effect that destroys a card is still applied even though “Breaker, the Magical Warrior” himself has been destroyed at that point.</li>
  <li>If I chain “Ring of Destruction” to the placement of a Spell Counter on “Breaker, the Magical Warrior”, “Ring of Destruction” does 1600 damage to each player because the action of placing the Spell Counter has not resolved.</li>

<h4 id="butterfly-dagger---elma">BUTTERFLY DAGGER - ELMA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing the Timing: Because the effect of “Butterfly Dagger – Elma” is an optional “when… you can” Trigger Effect, “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate its effect. So if it is destroyed in the middle of a chain, you cannot return it to your hand. Example: If the turn player activates “Pot of Greed”, and the opponent chains “Mystical Space Typhoon” to destroy “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” during the chain, it cannot return to the owner’s hand.</li>
  <li>If the monster that “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” is equipped to is destroyed as a result of battle, or by a card effect like “Sakuretsu Armor” or “Fissure”, then “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” cannot return to your hand because it is no longer equipped to a monster. However, if the monster and the “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” are destroyed simultaneously by a card like “Final Destiny”, then you can return it to your hand.</li>
  <li>While “Imperial Order” is active, if “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, it can return to your hand.</li>
  <li>When you activate “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” and your opponent chains “Mystical Space Typhoon”, it cannot return to your hand.</li>
  <li>When “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” is “sent to the Graveyard” without being “destroyed”, such as with “Woodland Sprite”, it cannot return to your hand.</li>
  <li>If “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” is negated and destroyed by “Ryu Senshi” or “Freed the Matchless General”, it cannot return to your hand.</li>
  <li>While “Morale Boost” is active, if you equip “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” to “Gearfried the Iron Knight”, 1) Increase your Life Points for “Morale Boost”, 2) destroy “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” with “Gearfried the Iron Knight”’s effect, 3) inflict damage for “Morale Boost” when “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” is sent to the Graveyard, 4) the owner of “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” can return it to his/her hand.</li>

  <li>If the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” is returned to the hand, “Call of the Haunted remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” is Tributed, “Call of the Haunted” remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If that monster is not in the Graveyard at the time of resolution, “Call of the Haunted” resolves without effect and remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” may be used to Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard during either player’s Battle Phase. If “Call of the Haunted” is successfully resolved during the opponent’s Battle Phase as a response to an attack declaration, a Replay is triggered.</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” may not be activated during the Damage Step.”</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed in a chain to the activation of “Call of the Haunted,” the monster that would be Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” is not Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” does not equip itself to “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” “Gearfried the Iron Knight” can be successfully summoned by “Call of the Haunted.”</li>
  <li>“Call of the Haunted” can Special Summon “Jinzo.” If “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed while “Jinzo” is face-up on the field, the monster targeted by “Call of the Haunted” will not be destroyed. If “Jinzo” is Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” and “Jinzo” is destroyed, “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If the opponent plays “Monster Reborn” targeting a specific monster in a player’s Graveyard, and “Call of the Haunted” is chained to the activation of “Monster Reborn” targeting the same monster, “Call of the Haunted” will resolve first removing that monster from the Graveyard. “Monster Reborn” will resolve without effect.</li>
  <li>If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is activated in a chain with the activation of “Call of the Haunted,” “Mystical Space Typhoon” will destroy the “Call of the Haunted” before “Call of the Haunted” Special Summons a monster. “Call of the Haunted’s” effect will then disappear. If “Call of the Haunted” is activated in a chain with a “Mystical Space Typhoon” that targets “Call of the Haunted,” “Call of the Haunted” will resolve first, Special Summoning a monster. “Mystical Space Typhoon” will then resolve destroying the “Call of the Haunted.” If “Call of the Haunted” is not negated at this point, the monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” will be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is used to Special Summon “Tyrant Dragon” and resolves successfully, “Call of the Haunted” will be negated and destroyed after “Tyrant Dragon” has been Special Summoned. “Tyrant Dragon” will remain on the field.</li>
  <li>If a Union monster like “Koitsu” is Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” and then uses its effect to equip itself to its Union counterpart, “Call of the Haunted” will no longer affect the Union monster and will remain face-up on the field meaninglessly.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Call Of The Haunted” was used to Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard and then “Book of Moon” was activated, or the monster’s own effect such as “Guardian Sphinx”, what would happen?<br />
A: The targeted monster would be changed to face-down Defense Position and would then be severed from the effect of “Call of the Haunted.” Even if the monster is later flipped face-up, it will still remain severed from the effect of “Call of the Haunted.” “Call of the Haunted” will remain on the field meaninglessly.

  <li>“Castle of Dark Illusions’s” effect will increase the ATK of Zombie monsters on the field by 200 per turn for each turn that “Castle of Dark Illusions” is face-up, for the duration of 4 turns on the Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Castle of Dark Illusions” leaves the field before the fourth Standby Phase, the ATK increase will stop increasing. Any ATK increase that occurred as a result of “Castle of Dark Illusions” will remain on the respective Zombie-Type monsters as long as those Zombie-Type remain face up on the field.</li>

  <li>Q: Would my face-up “Spirit Reaper” be destroyed if my “Castle of Dark Illusions” was flipped face-up and do Zombie-Type monsters place on the field face-up after “Castle of Dark Illusions” is face-up receive the increase?<br />
A: “Castle of Dark Illusion’s” effect is not a targetting effect. “Spirit Reaper” will not be destroyed by its effect. Any Zombies brought face-up on the field while “Castle of Dark Illusion’s” effect is active will get the increase. It does not matter if the Zombies were face-up on the field when “Castle of Dark Illusions” was flipped. Curtis Schultz, 12/08/2003</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Dark Ruler Ha Des” negate the effect of “Cats Ear Tribe”?<br />
A: The effect of the “Cat’s Ear Tribe” activates before the damage calculation. Dark Ruler Ha Des” needs to destroy the monster in battle in order to negate its effect. Since this has not happened yet, the “Cat’s Ear Tribe” effect would make the base ATK of “Dark Ruler Ha Des” become 200. Curtis Schultz, 03/14/2004</li>

<h4 id="centrifugal-field">CENTRIFUGAL FIELD</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only the owner of the Fusion Monster that was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect can Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster written on the Fusion Monster Card. However, this effect can be used by both players (when their Fusion Monsters are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect).</li>
  <li>If both players have Fusion Monsters destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by card effects at the same time, each of them can Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster. However, when multiple Fusion Monsters controlled by the same player are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect, that player can only select and Special Summon 1 Fusion Material Monster.</li>
  <li>Unlike “De-Fusion”, the Fusion Material Monsters Special Summoned with “Centrifugal Field” do not have to have been used to Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. In fact, that Fusion Monster does not have to have been properly Fusion Summoned at all (it could have been Special Summoned with “Magical Scientist” or “Summoner of Illusions” instead).</li>
  <li>Substitute Fusion Material Monsters like “King of the Swamp” cannot be Special Summoned with “Centrifugal Field” because they are not written on the Fusion Monster Card. However, if they were used as substitutes to Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster, you can still use “Centrifugal Field” to Special Summon the other Fusion Material monster from the Fusion Summon.</li>
  <li>You can chain to the activation of the effect of “Centrifugal Field”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cestus-of-dagla">CESTUS OF DAGLA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Airknight Parshath” equipped with “Cestus of Dagla” inflicts damage to your opponent’s Life Points, the simultaneous effects go on a chain, so the controller decides which effect is resolved first.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple copies of “Cestus of Dagla” equipped to your monster, the effects accumulate.</li>
  <li>When your opponent takes control of your Fairy-Type monster equipped with your “Cestus of Dagla”, and your opponent uses the monster to damage your Life Points, neither player increases their Life Points. This is because the controller of “Cestus of Dagla” is still you, and “Cestus of Dagla”’s effect only activates when the equipped monster inflicts damage to your opponent’s Life Points. Likewise, if you equip “Cestus of Dagla” to your opponent’s Fairy-Type monster, neither player will gain any Life Points from “Cestus of Dagla”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the monster equipped with “Cestus of Dagla” is not under the control of the controller of “Cestus of Dagla,” the Life Point gaining effect of “Cestus of Dagla” does not apply.</li>
  <li>“Cestus of Dagla” will trigger its Life Point gaining effect if the monster equipped with “Cestus of Dagla” attacks Life Points directly.</li>
  <li>If more than one “Cestus of Dagla” is equipped to the same monster, each “Cestus of Dagla” will trigger the Life Point gain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If a monster equipped with “Cestus of Dagla” attacks the opponent directly, will the controller of the monster gain Life Points?<br />
A: If you control both the equipped Fairy-Type monster AND the “Cestus of Dagla,” then you will gain Life Points equal to whatever amount of Battle Damage you have done to the opponent’s Life Points from that equipped monster’s attack. So if I have “Zolga” equipped with “Cestus of Dagla” and it attacks my opponent directly, I would gain 2200 Life Points by the effect of “Cestus of Dagla.” Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>

  <li>Monsters Special Summoned face-up by monster effects may be targeted by “Chain Destruction.”</li>
  <li>If “Chain Destruction” is activated in response to a Fusion monster being Special Summoned and that Fusion monster has less than 2000 ATK, all other copies of that Fusion monster in the affected player’s Fusion Deck are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>

<h4 id="chain-disappearance">CHAIN DISAPPEARANCE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can activate “Chain Disappearance” in response to your own Summon of a monster, in which case your opponent still removes all cards with that name from his hand and Deck.</li>
  <li>If you use “Chain Disappearance” in response to a Flip Summon, any Flip Effects like “Penguin Soldier” would still resolve. The Flip Effect is Step 1 of the chain, and “Chain Disappearance” is step 2.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Chain Disappearance” can remove multiple monsters that are Summoned simultaneously, for example if your opponent activates “Scapegoat”, you can respond with “Chain Disappearance” to remove all 4 “Sheep Tokens” that were Special Summoned from the field.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates “Chain Disappearance” and you chain “Ring of Destruction”, “Ring of Destruction” resolves first and destroys the monster and sends it to the Graveyard, and there is no monster of the same name so no cards are removed from play for the effect of “Chain Disappearance”.</li>
  <li>If you use “Chain Disappearance” when a Fusion Monster is Special Summoned, remove from play that Fusion Monster plus all copies of that Fusion Monster in the Fusion Deck.</li>

  <li>Cards Set previous to “Chain Energy” do not trigger the 500 Life Point cost.</li>
  <li>Cards brought to the field through another effect, like Special Summoning a monster through “Monster Reborn” do not trigger the 500 Life Point cost of “Chain Energy”.</li>

  <li>Q: If I have only 500 Life Points remaining with “Chain Energy” active on the field, can I activate “Poison of the Old Man” to increase my Life Points before losing the 500 points from the effect of “Chain Energy” and losing the Duel?<br />
A: When you play the “Poision of the Old Man” “Chain Energy” will cause you to pay 500 Life Points, reducing your Life Points to 0 before “Poison of the Old Man” can resolve. Curtis Schultz, 01/16/2004</li>

<h4 id="change-of-heart">CHANGE OF HEART</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You gain control of the targeted monster in the same Battle Position that it was in on your opponent’s side of the field. If it is face-down you may Flip Summon it and any Flip Effect is activated. During your End Phase it is returned to your opponent’s side of the field in the same Battle Position as you last had it in. So if you attacked with the monster and it remained in Attack Position, it will return to your opponent in Attack Position.</li>
  <li>You can use the monster you control through the effect of “Change of Heart” as a Tribute for a Tribute Summon, or for an effect like “Cannon Soldier’s”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Change of Heart” is a targeting Spell Card.</li>
  <li>It is not required to Flip the face-down monster taken control of by “Change of Heart” to look at it.</li>
  <li>If the monster affected by “Change of Heart” is turned face-down, that monster will return to the original controller at the End Phase as normal.</li>
  <li>If the monster affected by “Change of Heart” is temporarily removed from play, that monster will return to the original controller when the monster returns to play.</li>
  <li>A face-up “Blindly Loyal Goblin” may not be targeted by “Change of Heart.” If a face-down “Blindly Loyal Goblin” changes control through the effect of “Change of Heart” or similar cards and “Blindly Loyal Goblin” is turned face-up, control of “Blindly Loyal Goblin” will not return to the original controller.</li>
  <li>If a monster that changes control via “Change of Heart” is turned face-down by “Book of Moon,” the monster will return to the original controller’s field when the turn ends as normal per “Change of Heart.”</li>
  <li>If a monster that changes control via “Change of Heart” is temporarily removed from the field via “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter,” that monster will return to the original controller’s control when it returns to the field.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If the opponent activates “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” with only 3 Monster Zone spaces remaining and you chain with “Ojama Trio”, what will happen to the monster the opponent is trying to take control of?<br />
A: When they take control of the monster, if there are no longer any open Monster Zone spaces for the taken monster it will be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/28/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Can “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” be activated to destroy an opponent’s monster if all 5 Monster Zone spaces are full or does it only happen during the resolution of a chain?<br />
A: It is during the resolution of a chain. If you do not have any empty zones in your Monster Zone you cannot activate “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” to take control of an opponent’s monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If I use “Change of Heart” on a face up monster and then my opponent chains “Book of Moon” to flip his monster face-down, does my “Change of Heart” lose its target or do I get the monster that is now in face-down Defense Position?<br />
A: “Change of Heart” will take control of the monster as normal. “Change of Heart” can be used to take control of a face-up or face-down monster, so using “Book of Moon” doesn’t prevent “Change of Heart” from resolving, or the monster from returning at the end of the turn. Steve Okegawa, 02/11/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Say Player A plays “Snatch Steal” on Player B’s “Jinzo”. Then Player B uses “Change of Heart” on “Jinzo” and then “Book of Moon”. What would happen to “Jinzo”?<br />

<h4 id="chaos-command-magician">CHAOS COMMAND MAGICIAN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Chaos Command Magician” must be face-up to negate a monster effect; if face-down then “Chaos Command Magician” will not negate any effects.</li>
  <li>When “Chaos Command Magician” is targeted by a card that doesn’t select only 1 target, the effect of “Chaos Command Magician” is NOT applied and the effect resolves as normal.</li>
  <li>When “Penguin Soldier” targets 2 monsters, including “Chaos Command Magician”, this is an effect targets, but not one that select “1 target”. So “Chaos Command Magician” will not negate the effect of “Penguin Soldier”. However, if “Penguin Soldier” only targets “Chaos Command Magician”, then it is an effect that selects “1 target” so “Chaos Command Magician” WILL negate the effect of “Penguin Soldier”.</li>
  <li>Vs. “Dark Cat With White Tail”, that effect selects 3 targets so “Chaos Command Magician” will not negate “Dark Cat With White Tail”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If “Chaos Command Magician” is targeted by “Dark Necrofear”, that effect selects 1 target so the effect of “Dark Necrofear” is negated and it is not equipped to “Chaos Command Magician”.</li>
  <li>When “Chaos Command Magician” battles “D.D. Warrior Lady”, her effect is NOT negated because it does not target.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite” and target “Chaos Command Magician”, but “Chaos Command Magician” will negate the effect and “Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite” will remain on the field as a monster.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End” sends itself to the Graveyard as part of its effect, and counts itself for determining how much damage it inflicts.</li>
  <li>The damage that “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End” inflicts is equal to the number of cards BOTH players send to the Graveyard times 300 points.</li>
  <li>“Barrel Behind the Door” and “Trap of Board Eraser” can be chained to “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”’s effect. “Barrel Behind the Door” is, itself, sent to the Graveyard by “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”’s effect and counts for an additional 300 points as a result.</li>
  <li>If “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End” is destroyed or removed from play by an effect chained to its own effect, its effect still resolves.</li>
  <li>Tokens will be removed from the field by “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”’s effect, but will not add to the damage total because they are not sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>It is the controller, not the owner, of “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End” that can activate its effect and that inflicts damage to his/her opponent.</li>
  <li>If you control your opponent’s “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End” and you pay the 1000 Life Points, the effect inflicts damage to your opponent even though the monster returns to your opponent’s Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End” is Special Summoned, and the controller immediately activates its effect, and the opponent chains “Torrential Tribute” as Step 2 of a chain, “Torrential Tribute” destroys all monsters on the field and sends them to the Graveyard, then “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”’s effect resolves, sends all Spell &amp; Trap Cards on the field to the Graveyard, and inflicts 300 points of damage to the opponent for each Spell &amp; Trap Card sent to the Graveyard by its effect. (Monster Cards do not count toward the damage because they were destroyed and sent to the Graveyard in the middle of the chain by “Torrential Tribute”.)</li>
  <li>If “Waboku” is chained to the effect of “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, it will not prevent the damage because “Waboku” only applies to Battle Damage. Also, “Waboku” will still be on the field when “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”’s effect is applied, so it will still count for 300 points of damage to the opponent.</li>
  <li>When “Minar” and “Electric Snake” are sent to the Graveyard by “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, their effects are not activated because the modified text on those cards says when they are “discarded to the Graveyard from the hand”.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Will the effect of “Gravekeeper’s Watcher” stop the effect of “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”?<br />
A: “Discard” and “Send” are not the same. You cannot use “Gravekeeper’s Watcher” against the effect of the Chaos Emperor Dragon. Curtis Schultz, 03/07/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Can I chain “Super Rejuvenation” to “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End’”s effect and draw as many cards as Dragon Types discarded through “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”’s effect?<br />
A: “Super Rejuvenation” will not work with the effect of “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End.” “Super Rejuvenation” works for Dragon-Type monsters discarded from your hand or Tributed from your side of the field during the turn. “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End’s” effect does not Tribute any monsters. It does not discard any cards. Curtis Schultz, 03/10/2004</li>

<h4 id="chaos-necromancer">CHAOS NECROMANCER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you equip “Chaos Necromancer” with “Axe of Despair” and have 5 monsters in your Graveyard, the ATK of “Chaos Necromancer” is 2500 (1500 + 1000).</li>

<h4 id="chiron-the-mage">CHIRON THE MAGE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discarding 1 Spell Card is a cost to activate this effect.</li>
  <li>If you activate the effect of “Chiron the Mage”, then flip it face-down, then flip it face-up all in the same turn, you can activate its effect again.</li>
  <li>The restriction that you can only activate this effect once per turn is a condition, not an effect. So if “Skill Drain” is on the field, you can pay the cost once per turn (for no effect), but not pay the cost continuously in the same turn.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the “Poisonous Snake Token” is destroyed as a result of battle, it is the opponent of “Cobra Jar”’s controller that takes the damage; so even if the opponent had taken control of the “Poisonous Snake Token” with “Change of Heart”, he/she still takes the damage when it is destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Cocoon of Evolution” is Summoned or Set it is treated as a monster, if played as an Equip Spell Card it is treated as an Equip Spell Card as long as it remains on the field and could be destroyed with “Mystical Space Typhoon”. Once on the field it cannot be switched from monster to Spell Card or vice versa. “Cocoon of Evolution” is NOT a Union Monster.</li>

  <li>Union monsters may still use their effect of equipping themselves to an appropriate monster if “Cold Wave” has been activated.</li>
  <li>If “Cold Wave” has been activated, “Cocoon of Evolution” may not be equipped onto “Petit Moth.”</li>
  <li>If “Cold Wave” has been activated, “Thousand Eyes Restrict” may still use its effect to force a monster to equip to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: “Cold Wave” negates continuous spell and or trap cards, this includes equipments too, right?<br />
A: “Cold Wave” makes it so you can’t “play” (activate) or “Set” Spell or Trap Cards, and extends to “activating” effects of Spell/Trap Cards already on the field. But “Cold Wave” will not negate continuous effects of cards like “United We Stand” that were in play BEFORE “Cold Wave” was activated. bishop, 12/08/2003</li>

  <li>Monster Cards equipped to “Relinquished” or “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” can be moved to another “Relinquished or “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” but if either of these monsters is already equipped with a Monster Card, the new one is destroyed. If these moved to any other monster, the cards are destroyed.</li>
  <li>You can move “Snatch Steal” with this card’s effect, and it will affect the newly equipped monster (the controller of “Snatch Steal” gains control of it, and loses control of the previously equipped monster).</li>
  <li>If a “Premature Burial” already equipped to a monster is moved to a new monster by the effect of “Collected Power”, both “Premature Burial” and the original monster it was equipped to are destroyed. If you chain “Collected Power” to “Premature Burial”, the monster in the Graveyard that was targeted never leaves the Graveyard and “Premature Burial” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If multiple Union Monsters are going to be equipped to 1 legal target monster by “Collected Power”, you select 1 of them and equip it to the target monster, and the other Union Monster Cards are destroyed.</li>

<h4 id="combination-attack">COMBINATION ATTACK</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card targets.</li>
  <li>Both the equipped monster and the Union Monster can attack after “Combination Attack” is used, assuming the Union Monster was Special Summoned in face-up Attack Position.</li>
  <li>“Combination Attack” can only be used against a monster that reached the Damage Step; if a monster attacks and a replay occurs, then it is not considered to have attacked for purposes of “Combination Attack”.</li>
  <li>You can use this effect on an equipped monster on your opponent’s side of the field that has attacked. Your opponent’s monster can then attack again as per “Combination Attack”’s effect.</li>
  <li>You can attack with a Union Monster, use “Formation Union” to equip it to a monster, attack with the equipped monster, activate “Combination Attack” to detach the Union Monster, and attack again with the previously-equipped monster and with the Union Monster.</li>
  <li>If “Dark Blade”, equipped with “Kiryu” and “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce”, attacks twice using “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce”’s effect, then you use “Combination Attack” to detach “Kiryu” from “Dark Blade”, both monsters can attack again once each. “Dark Blade” cannot attack another 2 times because it has already attacked twice.</li>
  <li>If the player who would control the Union Monster already has 5 monsters on the field, “Combination Attack” cannot be activated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="command-knight">COMMAND KNIGHT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you control a “Command Knight” equipped with “Ring of Magnetism”, and another monster, your opponent can and must select “Command Knight” as an attack target if he chooses to attack.</li>
  <li>If you control 2 face-up “Command Knights”, and no other monsters, and 1 of them is equipped with “Ring of Magnetism”, your opponent cannot attack because the 2 “Command Knights” are preventing an attack from being declared. “Ring of Magnetism”’s effect forcefully leads the attack to the equipped monster only when the opponent declares an attack, which is impossible for your opponent to do.</li>
  <li>If “Umi” is active and you have “The Legendary Fisherman” on the field, your opponent can attack directly. But if you have “Legendary Fisherman” and “Command Knight”, and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack directly because of “Command Knight”, and cannot attack “Command Knight” because of his effect, and cannot attack “The Legendary Fisherman”, so he cannot declare an attack (but can enter the Battle Phase to activate card effects).</li>
  <li>If you control “Patrician of Darkness” and “Command Knight”, and your opponent attacks, you cannot choose the “Command Knight” as the attack target.</li>
  <li>If you control “Command Knight” equipped with “Raregold Armor”, your opponent can attack “Command Knight”.</li>
  <li>If you control a “Command Knight” and another monster, and your opponent attacks the other monster, you can use “Shift” to select “Command Knight” as the new attack target.</li>
  <li>You can choose your own “Command Knight” as the attack target when your opponent attacks your “Dreamsprite”.</li>
  <li>“Command Knight”’s effect increases its own ATK by 400 points, in addition to your other Warrior-Type monsters.</li>
  <li>If you control multiple “Command Knights”, their effects are cumulative so each will increase all of your Warrior-Type monsters’ ATK by 400 points.</li>
  <li>If “Command Knight” is Normal Summoned, Flip summoned, or Special Summoned, its ATK is at least 1600 so your opponent can activate “Bottomless Trap Hole”.</li>
  <li>If “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field face-up, and “Command Knight” is Summoned, the effect of “Command Knight” is applied immediately because it is a Continuous Effect, so first change “Command Knight”’s ATK to 1600. After that, “King Tiger Wanghu”’s effect cannot activate because “Command Knight”’s ATK is not 1400 or lower.</li>
  <li>If “Physical Double” creates a Mirage Token of a Warrior-Type monster while “Command Knight” is on the field, take the current ATK (including “Command Knight” Bonus), then apply all bonuses again if appropriate. So a Mirage Token of a 1600 ATK Warrior-Type monster would be ATK 2000 (it copies the 1600 ATK and then gains “Command Knight”’s +400 ATK bonus).</li>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, can you chain “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to the effect of a Flip Effect Monster when its Flip Summoned such as “Fiber Jar” or “Cyber Jar” and resolve their effects?<br />
A: Yes, you can chain “Compusory Evacuation Device” to the flip effect of “Cyber Jar” and “Fiber Jar” when you Flip Summon them. The “Cyber Jar”/”Fiber Jar” would return to your hand first, then its effect would resolve. Since it would not be face-up on the field when its effect resolves, “Skill Drain” will not negate it.

<h4 id="continuous-destruction-punch">CONTINUOUS DESTRUCTION PUNCH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Continuous Destruction Punch” is like “Destruction Punch” except it’s a Continuous Spell Card that you activate during your Main Phase.</li>
  <li>A monster destroyed because of “Continuous Destruction Punch” is destroyed by “Continuous Destruction Punch”’s effect, not “as a result of battle”.</li>
  <li>The determination of whether a monster is destroyed by “Continuous Destruction Punch”’s effect happens at Damage Calculation, so Flip Effects, etc., are resolved AFTER “Continuous Destruction Punch”’s effect destroys a monster (but does not yet send it to the Graveyard). Then, after applying Flip Effects, send a monster destroyed by this card (or by Damage Calculation) to the Graveyard.</li>

<h4 id="contract-with-exodia">CONTRACT WITH EXODIA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<h4 id="contract-with-the-abyss">CONTRACT WITH THE ABYSS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Contract with the Abyss” is used as a generic substitute for Ritual Spell Cards like “Black Illusion Ritual” and “Contract with the Dark Master”. You cannot use “Contract with the Abyss” to Ritual Summon a non-Ritual Monster like “Dark Magician”.</li>
  <li>“Cost Down” will not reduce the number of Level Stars needed to perform a Ritual Summon, even if used with “Contract with the Abyss”.</li>
  <li>If you Ritual Summon a Ritual Monster using “Contract with the Abyss”, it is considered properly Summoned, so you can use “Monster Reborn” on it afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: “Contract with the Abyss” states in its text that the Level Stars of the monsters being offered as a Tribute equal that of the Ritual Monster being Ritual Summoned. Can the total of Level Stars being offered be higher than the Ritual Monster or must it be exactly equal?<br />
A: The total Level Stars of the monster(s) offered as a Tribute for the Ritual Summon using “Contract with the Abyss” must equal the Level Stars of the DARK Ritual Monster you are attempting to Ritual Summon. You cannot go above the Level Stars of the DARK Ritual Monster. So if I want to Ritual Summon “Dark Master - Zorc” using “Contract with Abyss,” I must offer monsters whose total Level Stars = 8. I cannot go above 8. I could offer two 4-Level Star monsters and the total would equal 8. I could offer four 2-Level Star monsters, because they would equal 8. I would not be able to offer a 5-Level Star and a 4-Level Star monster because their total Level Stars would equal 9. Curtis Schultz, 02/23/2004</li>

<h4 id="cost-down">COST DOWN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Level of a monster which is Summoned using “Cost Down” is still decreased by 2 after Summoning. The 2 Level reduction lasts until the End Phase.</li>
  <li>When you Ritual Summon while “Cost Down” is active, the Level Stars that you need is not changed, even if you are using “Contract with the Abyss” or “Earth Chant”.</li>
  <li>You can use multiple “Cost Downs” in the same turn and their effects accumulate, so 3 “Cost Downs” lowers the level by 6 Stars.</li>
  <li>While “A Legendary Ocean” and 1 “Cost Down” are active, your WATER monsters are reduced by 3 Stars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Cost Down’s” effect lasts for the duration of the turn “Cost Down” resolved. This includes if the monster is summoned to the field.</li>
  <li>“Cost Down” allows for the Normal Summon of Level 5 and 6 monsters.</li>
  <li>If two “Cost Downs” are activated in the same turn, the Star Level of all monsters in the hand will be reduced by 4.</li>

  <li>“Cost Down” has no effect on the monsters revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2” as the monsters are never considered in the hand.</li>
  <li>If “Cost Down” is used before the Summon of “Maju Garzett” or “Great Maju Garzett”, the ATK of both monsters will be 0 as they were not Tribute Summoned with the appropriate number of monsters.</li>
  <li>If “Cost Down” has been activated in the same Turn before a “Marauding Captain” is Normal Summoned, a Level 5 or 6 monster may be Special Summoned through the effect of “Marauding Captain.”</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: What would happen if you used “Cost Down,” and then you use “Contract with the Abyss” to summon “Relinquished,” would it still count as a Level 1 monster?<br />
A: “Contract with the Abyss” should be written as “This card is used to Ritual Summon any DARK Monster. You must also offer monsters from the field or you hand whose total Level Stars equal the ORIGINAL Level Stars of the Ritual Monster you are attempting to Ritual Summon.” bishop, 12/22/2003</li>
  <li>Q: If “Cost Down” resolves and “Contract with the Abyss” is played for “The Masked Beast”, is discarding a Blue Eyes from the hand still enough, or must I add monsters until the total number of post-“Cost Down” stars on the Tributed monsters equals the “The Masked Beast’s” full value (8 stars)?<br />

<h4 id="creature-swap">CREATURE SWAP</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Creature Swap” does not target. The monsters are chosen when its effect resolves, not when “Creature Swap” is activated.</li>
  <li>The opponent cannot chain “Fairy’s Hand Mirror”, “Riryoku Field”, or “Shift” to “Creature Swap” because it does not target. For the same reason, “Lord of D.” does not prevent Dragon-Type monsters from being selected, and “Freed the Matchless General” will not negate the effect of “Creature Swap”.</li>
  <li>Both players must have at least 1 eligible monster on the field for “Creature Swap” to be activated. If the opponent chains a card (such as “Ring of Destruction”) to destroy the only monster on one side of the field, the effect of “Creature Swap” disappears.</li>
  <li>Monsters affected by “Creature Swap” do not return to their owner’s control at the end of the turn, they stay under the opponent’s control until removed from the field or a card effect such as “Remove Brainwashing” says otherwise.</li>
  <li>The battle position of monsters affected by “Creature Swap” may be changed by card effects the turn “Creature Swap” was activated.</li>
  <li>A player may select a monster that had its battle position changed earlier in the turn (manually or by card effect).</li>
  <li>A player may select a Monster Token.</li>
  <li>A player may select a monster Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”. If the “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”, still on the opponent’s side of the field, is destroyed, the monster targeted by those cards is destroyed also.</li>
  <li>A player may select a monster that is equipped with “Snatch Steal”. The original owner of the creature, who now controls the creature again, will still gain 1000 Life Points each turn from the opponent’s “Snatch Steal” card as long as it remains on the field.</li>
  <li>A player may activate “Change of Heart” to gain control of an opponent’s monster, and then activate “Creature Swap” and select that monster to return to the opponent. At the end of the turn, the monster targeted by “Change of Heart” does not switch sides again since it is already on the owner’s side of the field.</li>

<h4 id="creeping-doom-manta">CREEPING DOOM MANTA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>You can activate Trap Cards later in the turn.</li>
  <li>You can negate the Normal Summon of this monsters with “Horn of Heaven” or “Solemn Judgment”. (In which case the Normal Summon failed and the effect of the monster is not applied.)</li>
  <li>The effect of this monster is applied to both players (so you cannot activate “Pineapple Blast” in response to your Normal Summon of this monster).</li>
  <li>This is a Continuous Effect that you cannot chain to.</li>

<h4 id="criosphinx">CRIOSPHINX</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Criosphinx” is a Trigger Effect, and can be chained to. You can activate “Divine Wrath” against it. If a monster is returned to the hand in the middle of a chain, the effect of “Criosphinx” activates as a new chain after the previous chain has finished resolving.</li>
  <li>If multiple copies of “Criosphinx” are in play and a monster is returned to the hand, all copies will activate. It forms a chain, with the turn player’s “Criosphinx” as chain link 1.</li>
  <li>If multiple monsters are sent to the hand simultaneously (such as with “Guardian Sphinx”), the effect of “Criosphinx” only activates once, so only 1 card is discarded.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cross-counter">CROSS COUNTER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You activate “Cross Counter” before damage calculation but after flipping the attacked monster face-up. The “Cross Counter” card is sent to the Graveyard after resolving its effect and destroying the attacking monster.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Cross Counter” only applies to the one attack and does not continue for the rest of the turn.</li>
  <li>If your opponent’s “Amazoness Swords Woman” attacks your Defense Position “Mystical Elf”, and you activate “Cross Counter”, you (the controller of “Cross Counter” and “Mystical Elf”) take 1000 points of damage due to the effect of “Amazoness Swords Woman”, and then “Cross Counter” destroys “Amazoness Swords Woman”.</li>
  <li>“Cross Counter” is not an effect that targets.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Cross Counter” that destroys a monster does not start a chain.</li>
  <li>If your “Stone Statue of the Aztecs” is defending and you activate “Cross Counter” the Battle Damage your opponent takes is only doubled once (by either the effect of “Cross Counter” or “Stone Statue of the Aztecs”).</li>

<h4 id="curse-of-aging">CURSE OF AGING</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot decrease ATK/DEF by 1000 points by discarding 2 cards; you can only discard 1 card.</li>
  <li>Discarding a card is a cost.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Curse of Aging” is not applied to face-down monsters. It is only applied to the face-up monsters on the field when “Curse of Aging” resolves. It is not applied to monsters Summoned after “Curse of Aging” resolves, either. (Similar to “Limiter Removal”). This means that even if face-down monsters are flipped face-up in the same turn, their ATK or DEF are not changed by the effect of “Curse of Aging”, even if they were on the field (face-down) when “Curse of Aging” resolved.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="curse-of-darkness">CURSE OF DARKNESS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Curse of Darkness” inflicts 1000 damage right after the Spell Card is activated, not when it resolves. If the Spell Card’s activation is negated however, such as with “Magic Jammer”, then no damage is inflicted because the activation was negated.</li>
  <li>“Curse of Darkness” does not form a new chain and cannot be chained to. You can chain to the Spell Card itself, after “Curse of Darkness” inflicts its 1000 damage.</li>
  <li>Even if your opponent targets your face-up “Curse of Darkness” with “Mystical Space Typhoon”, he/she takes 1000 damage before “Mystical Space Typhoon” resolves and destroys “Curse of Darkness”.</li>
  <li>When “Curse of Darkness” is active, and you activate “Double Spell”, you take 1000 damage for activating “Double Spell” but not for the target of “Double Spell”, because it is not considered “activated”.</li>
  <li>If you send “Curse of Darkness” to the Graveyard as part of the cost of “Emergency Provisions”, then “Curse of Darkness” is no longer on the field immediately after activation of “Emergency Provisions”, and “Curse of Darkness’” effect is not activated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If more than one “Curse of Darkness” is active on the field, a player activating a Spell Card will take 1000 Damage for each active “Curse of Darkness.”</li>
  <li>You cannot chain to Curse of Darkness’s effect dealing 1000 damage, because it is a Continuous Effect. Naturally, you can still chain to the Spell Card, of course. This means that chaining the activation of Curse of Darkness (flipping it face-up) to the activation of a Spell Card will not inflict any damage because Curse of Darkness was not active when the Spell Card was activated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="curse-of-fiend">CURSE OF FIEND</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Face-down Defense position monsters will be changed to face-up Attack position by the effect of “Curse of Fiend.” Any applicable Flip Effects will activate at that time.</li>

</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Curse of Fiend’s” effect work on Set monsters and would it be considered a Flip Summon?<br />
A: A Set monster would be changed to face-up attack position. It would not be considered Flip-Summoned, because its position was changed by a card effect, but its Flip-Effect would activate if it had one. Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004</li>

  <li>Curse of Royal can only be used against Spell &amp; Trap Cards.</li>
  <li>If a card can destroy either a Spell or Trap Card or a Monster Card, like “Raigeki Break” or “Solemn Judgment,” it must be targeting 1 Spell or Trap Card to activate “Curse of Royal.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Can you flip “Curse of Royal” to negate and destroy “Raigeki” if one of your monsters has an equip card attached that would be destroyed once the monster is destroyed?<br />
A: No, because “Raigeki” does not specifically destroy one Spell or Trap card in your Spell and Trap card zone. You can use it against Spell or Trap cards like “Magic Jammer,” “Seven Tools of the Bandit,” “Solemn Judgment,” “Curse of Royal,” “Mystical Space Typhoon,” “Dust Tornado,” “Magic Drain,” and “Riryoku Field.” Curtis Schultz, 12/04/2003</li>

  <li>If “Cyber-Stein” is summoned while “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field, the turn player is not able to use the effect “Cyber-Stein” before it is destroyed. The trigger effect of “King Tiger Wanghu” is a mandatory trigger that goes on the chain in response to a Summon before either player can manually respond, so while the Turn Player will still retain priority, they will only be able to use a spell speed 2 or 3 effect with it.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Cybernetic Magician” is an Ignition Effect that targets a monster.</li>
  <li>Since “Cybernetic Magician” makes the ATK “become” 2000, that is the new value. Even if the monster was equipped with an Equip Spell Card, the ATK is 2000 and is not adjusted, even if the Equip Spell Card is destroyed. (However, if equipped after the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” resolves, the ATK will be adjusted from the new level of 2000 points.)</li>
  <li>If a monster is getting an ATK adjustment because of a Field Spell Card, and you use the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” on it, then its ATK becomes 2000 and is not adjusted by the Field Spell Card until the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” expires.

  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is face-down on the field while “Banisher of the Light” is in play, and “D.D. Scout Plane” is destroyed by “Raigeki Break”, it is removed from play and its effect activates because it is placed face-up out of play.</li>
  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des” and then removed from play to Special Summon “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, “D.D. Scout Plane”’s effect activates and it will be Special Summoned.</li>

  <li>If “D.D. Scout Plane” is removed during an End Phase, it is Special Summoned with its effect during that same End Phase.</li>

<h4 id="dd-trap-hole">D.D. TRAP HOLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Set”, as a verb (as in the first sentence of “D.D. Trap Hole”), means placing a monster face-down. So you can activate “D.D. Trap Hole” when your opponent Sets a monster from the hand, or Special Summons a monster face-down with “The Shallow Grave”, or flips his monster face-down with a card effect.</li>
  <li>“Set”, as an adjective (as in the second sentence of “D.D. Trap Hole”), means a face-down monster. So if “Ceasefire” is chained to “D.D. Trap Hole”, the effect of “D.D. Trap Hole” disappears because the opponent’s monster is no longer Set.</li>
  <li>If either targeted monster is removed from play before “D.D. Trap Hole” resolves, then the effect of “D.D. Trap Hole” disappears.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “D.D. Trap Hole” during the damage step.</li>
  <li>If your opponent Sets more than 1 monster simultaneously, as with “Cyber Jar”, you cannot activate “D.D. Trap Hole”. You can only activate it when your opponent Sets 1 (and only 1) monster. (In the case of “The Shallow Grave” your opponent is only Setting 1 monster, even though you are Setting 1 too. So you can activate “D.D. Trap Hole”.)</li>
  <li>You can select a Token as your monster to destroy and remove from play from your side of the field for “D.D. Trap Hole”.</li>
  <li>“D.D. Trap Hole” is an effect that targets. It targets 1 of your monsters and your opponent’s monster that was just Set.</li>
  <li>If you select your monster equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform” for your monster to destroy with “D.D. Trap Hole”, then “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is destroyed instead and is sent to the Graveyard. Your opponent’s monster is destroyed and removed from play.</li>

<h4 id="ddm---different-dimension-master">D.D.M. - DIFFERENT DIMENSION MASTER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discarding a Spell Card is a cost. The effect of this monster targets a face-up monster that is removed from play. If “D.D.M. – Different Dimension Master” is flipped face-down or removed from the field, its effect resets and you can use it again that same turn if you can get him face-up on the field again.</li>
  <li>If the opponent chains “Book of Moon” to his effect and flips “D.D.M. – Different Dimension Master” face-down, you still resolve his effect.</li>
  <li>You cannot Special Summon a monster that was removed from play face-down using “Lightforce Sword” or “Different Dimension Capsule”.</li>
  <li>“D.D.M. – Different Dimension Master” can Special Summon monsters in the “removed zone” of its controller. If your opponent controls your monster because of “Creature Swap” and it is removed from play, you can Special Summon it with “D.D.M. – Different Dimension Master” because it is in your removed zone. When the effect of “D.D.M. – Different Dimension Master” is used, the target monster is Special Summoned to the field of the player who controls “D.D.M. – Different Dimension Master”.</li>

<h4 id="dark-balter-the-terrible">DARK BALTER THE TERRIBLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first sentence of this card’s text means that monsters such as “Beastking of the Swamps” cannot be used as a substitute for one of the required Fusion Material Monsters. You CAN use the effect of “Magical Scientist” or “Summoner of Illusions” to Special Summon this card like any other Fusion Monster.</li>
  <li>You can only use this card’s effect to negate Normal Spell Cards, not Quick-Play, Equip, Continuous, Field, or Ritual Spell Cards. This effect is a Multi-Trigger Effect, so it is Spell Speed 2 and may be activated during the opponent’s turn.</li>
  <li>This card’s effect only negates the effect of a Spell Card when it is activated, not the activation. So if your opponent activates “Swords of Revealing Light” and you activate the effect of this card to negate it, it will remain meaninglessly on the field for 3 turns. Its effect will remain negated for all 3 turns even if “Dark Balter the Terrible” is later destroyed.</li>
  <li>This card’s effect to negate the effect of Effect Monsters that it destroys as a result of battle is a separate effect from the other one; you do not pay Life Points to activate it. This effect works the same as the effect of “Dark Ruler Ha Des”; see that card’s rulings for more details.</li>

  <li>If “Dark Balter the Terrible” destroys “Marie the Fallen One” in battle, “Marie the Fallen One’s” Graveyard effect of ‘increase the players Life Points by 200 each Standby Phase’ is negated.</li>
  <li>If “Dark Balter the Terrible” attacks a face up attack position “Reflect Bounder”, “Reflect Bounder’s” effect of inflicting Damage equal to the ATK of the attacking monster will not be negated. If “Dark Balter the Terrible” destroys “Reflect Bounder,” “Reflect Bounder” will be considered destroyed as a result of Battle and not as a result of “Reflect Bounder’s” effect.</li>
  <li>If “Dark Balter the Terrible” destroys “Sinister Serpent” in battle, “Sinister Serpent’s” effect of returning to the hand from the Graveyard during the Standby Phase is negated.</li>
  <li>Since “Dark Balter the Terrible” cannot destroy “Spirit Reaper” in battle because of “Spirit Reaper’s” effect, “Spirit Reaper” is not destroyed nor negated by “Dark Balter the Terrible.”</li>
  <li>If “Dark Balter the Terrible” destroys “Witch of the Black Forest,” “Witch of the Black Forest’s” effect is negated and “Witch of the Black Forest” will not receive its searching effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Dark Balter the Terrible” attacks a Monster Token, will it negate the effect of that Monster Token?<br />

  <li>To activate “Dark Cat With White Tail”’s effect, there must be a minimum of 2 monsters on your opponent’s side of the field and a minimum of 1 monster on your side of the field.</li>
  <li>When “Dark Cat With White Tail” is attacked, flipped, and destroyed by an attack, you cannot select the cat itself for its effect so if the cat was your only monster, the cat’s effect is not applied.</li>

  <li>If “Dark Catapulter” is flipped face-down or removed from the field, all counters on it are removed for no effect.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is activated, all counters on “Dark Catapulter” are removed for no effect.</li>

  <li>If “Solemn Judgment” is used to negate the Special Summon of “Dark Necrofear,” “Dark Necrofear” will activate its equipping effect during the End Phase of that turn as “Solemn Judgment” destroyed “Dark Necrofear.” “Dark Necrofear” will not be able to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard as its Summon was negated.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Dark Necrofear’s” effect activate if you have a full Monster field?<br />
A: If your Monster Zone is full, you cannot activate the effect of “Dark Necrofear” and the effect disappears. bishop 02/23/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If “Dark Necrofear’s” ATK value is lowered upon summoning and targeted by “Chain Destruction”, will the other copies of “Dark Necrofear”, which were destroyed by “Chain Destruction” activate?<br />
A: Yes the “Dark Necrofears” would activate their effects during the End Phase, since they were destroyed by an opponent’s card effect. Keep in mind that they would not be able to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard as a monster though, since they were never Special Summoned once before via their effect. Curtis Schultz, 01/21/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If “Dark Necrofear” is equipped to an opponent’s monster, giving me control of it, and my opponent uses a card such as “Mystical Space Typhoon,” to destroy “Dark Necrofear”, can I activate “A Deal With Dark Ruler” when “Dark Necrofear” hits the graveyard?<br />
A: “Dark Necrofear” was an Equip Spell Card at the time it was destroyed by “Mystical Space Typhoon” and sent to the Graveyard. It was not a monster. Because of this, you would not be able to activate “A Deal with Dark Ruler.” Curtis Schultz, 03/04/2004</li>

  <li>Flip Effects and effects that activate in the Graveyard WILL be negated. This includes “Sinister Serpent”, “Sangan”, “Witch of the Black Forest”, “Marie the Fallen One”, “Mystic Tomato”, “Giant Rat”, “Masked Dragon”, “Magician of Faith”, “Man-Eater Bug”, “Nimble Momonga”, “Twin-Headed Behemoth”, etc.</li>
  <li>Monster effects that activate after damage calculation will be negated if your Fiend-Type monster destroys the opposing Effect Monster. Examples include “D.D. Warrior Lady”, “Thousand Needles”, “Slate Warrior”, “Ryu Kokki”, and “Wall of Illusion”.</li>
  <li>If an Effect Monster, destroyed by a Fiend-Type monster while “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is on the field, is returned from the Graveyard to the hand or Special Summoned from the Graveyard, its effect will be active again. Its effect may be negated again if destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des” or another Fiend-Type monster.</li>
  <li>If one of these Effect Monsters is removed from play (by “Soul Release” for example) and then returned to the Graveyard with “Miracle Dig”, the negation condition was lost and the effects will now be active.</li>
  <li>If “Kisetai” is attacked by a Fiend-Type monster while “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is on the field, its effect prevents damage calculation, so it is not destroyed and its effect is NOT negated.</li>
  <li>If “Sinister Serpent”, “Twin-Headed Behemoth”, or “Marie the Fallen One” is destroyed by a Fiend-Type monster when this card is on the field, they will not activate on any following turn. So during your opponent’s next Standby Phase, and each of his/her following Standby Phases, they may NOT move “Sinister Serpent” to their hand, Special Summon “Twin-Headed Behemoth”, and they will NOT gain Life Points by the effect of “Marie the Fallen One”. This negation continues even if “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is later removed from the field.</li>
  <li>If your Fiend-Type monster battles with “Relinquished” equipped with a “Sangan” or a “Witch of the Black Forest” and the equipped card is destroyed instead of “Relinquished”, the effect of “Sangan”, etc., will activate since it was the effect of “Relinquished” that destroyed it. It was not destroyed as a result of battle with the Fiend-Type monster.</li>
  <li>If your “Dark Ruler Ha Des” or other Fiend-Type monster destroys “Tyrant Dragon” as a result of battle, a Dragon-Type monster must still be Tributed when “Tyrant Dragon” is Special Summoned from the Graveyard. This is because Tributing a Dragon-Type monster is a condition on the Summoning of the card; it is not part of the effect. For the same reason, if a Spirit Monster is destroyed by a Fiend-Type monster when “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is on the field, it still cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard. Also if two “Dark Ruler Ha Des” destroy each other in battle, neither can be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>“Dark Ruler Ha Des” cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard even if you try to Special Summon it face-down by the effect of “Spear Cretin” or “The Shallow Grave”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Return of the Doomed” to return “Dark Ruler Ha Des” to your hand during the turn which it was destroyed, because this does not Special Summon it, it merely returns the card to your hand.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Fiber Jar” will shuffle “Dark Ruler Ha Des” back into your Deck even if “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is in the Graveyard and cannot be Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>“Dark Ruler Ha Des” may be Special Summoned by “Dimension Fusion” or “Return from the Different Dimension” if it was removed from play.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Decayed Commander”’s card-discarding effect only activates when “Decayed Commander” attacks directly AND deals 1 or more points of Battle Damage to the opponent, so if the opponent uses “Kuriboh” or “Waboku” then “Decayed Commander”’s effect does not activate.</li>

  <li>Monsters with “?” for ATK are treated as having an ATK of zero for this effect, while they are in the hand or face-down.</li>
  <li>If “Deck Devastation Virus” is active and you activate “Graceful Charity”, first draw 3 cards, then discard 2 cards for the effect of “Graceful Charity”, then, if any of the monsters you drew with “Graceful Charity” are still in your hand and they have ATK 1500 or less, they are destroyed. Similarly, if you activate “Good Goblin Housekeeping”, return the 1 card to the bottom of your deck, and then destroy any monsters in your hand with ATK 1500 or less.</li>

  <li>You also check face-down monsters on the field for “Deck Devastation Virus”. If “Maju Garzett” is face-down on the field, its ATK is treated as zero so it will be destroyed.</li>
  <li>You only check the cards on the field and in the hand when “Deck Devastation Virus” is resolved. Only cards drawn are checked until the end of the third End Phase.</li>
  <li>If you return “Sinister Serpent” to your hand after “Deck Devastation Virus” has resolved, it will NOT be destroyed, because it was not drawn.</li>

  <li>After you attack with a Fusion Monster, you may activate “De-Fusion” in the End Step of the Battle Phase to Special Summon the appropriate Fusion Material Monsters and attack with them in the same Battle Phase.</li>
  <li>If you activate “De-Fusion” and select a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned by “Magical Scientist” or “Metamorphosis” you can return the Fusion Monster to the owner’s Fusion Deck, but cannot Special Summon any Fusion Material Monsters since none were used.</li>
  <li>Netrep Q&amp;As:</li>
  <li>Q: Can “De-Fusion” be used against an opponent’s X-Y-Z Fusion Monster to send it back to the Fusion Deck without Special Summoning the Fusion Material Monsters?</li>
  <li>A: “De-Fusion” can be used on the 4 X, Y, and Z Fusion variations. The result will be the X-Y-Z Fusion monster being returned to the Fusion Deck. No monsters will be Special Summoned from the Graveyard because the X-Y-Z Fusions are not proper Fusion Summons. It will not matter if the X-Y-Z piece exists in the Graveyard. This is similar to using “De-Fusion” on a Fusion Monster Special Summoned through the effect of “Magical Scientist” and/or “Summoner of Illusions.” Curtis Schultz, 01/17/2004</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a face-up Flip Effect monster, you can activate “Desert Sunlight”, and chain “Book of Moon”, another “Desert Sunlight”, and another “Book of Moon”. When the chain resolves, you will flip the monster down, then up, then down, then back up. The Flip Effect activates twice, and they wait to create a new chain after the current one resolves.

</ul>

<h4 id="desrook-archfiend">DESROOK ARCHFIEND</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing the Timing: Because “Desrook Archfiend”’s effect is optional, the “Terrorking Archfiend” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate “Desrook Archfiend”’s effect. You cannot activate “Desrook Archfiend”’s effect in the middle of a chain, such as if “Pot of Greed” was activated and “Ring of Destruction” was chained to destroy “Terrorking Archfiend” and send him to the Graveyard in the middle of the chain.</li>

  <li>When you control your opponent’s “Terrorking Archfiend” with “Change of Heart”, and it is destroyed, you can activate “Desrook Archfiend” from your hand to Special Summon the “Terrorking Archfiend” back to your side of the field.</li>
  <li>While “Pandemonium” is active, and you have “Desrook Archfiend” in your hand, and your “Terrorking Archfiend” is destroyed while on the field, “Pandemonium” is Step 1 of a chain , but you can use “Desrook Archfiend” as Step 2 of the chain. Then you would get to Special Summon the “Terrorking Archfiend” and select a Level 3 or lower Archfiend from your Deck.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If multiple “Terrorking Archfiends” are destroyed at the same time, only one “Desrook Archfiend” may be discarded to Special Summon one “Terrorking Archfiend.”</li>
  <li>“Desrook Archfiend”, if retrieved by the effect of “Pandemonium” from a “Terrorking Archfiend” being destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, may not be used to Special Summon “Terrorking Archfiend” from the Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="destiny-board">DESTINY BOARD</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “proper order” in the text of “Destiny Board” means the order the Spirit Messages are placed on the field, not the order that they occupy your Spell and Trap Card Zones. So if you read your Zones from left to right as N-F-A-I-L, it is okay as long as they came on the field in the order of F-I-N-A-L.</li>

  <li>If “Imperial Order” is active on the field it will not stop the effect of “Destiny Board” to place Spirit Messages on the field, nor will it stop a player who completes the message from declaring victory.</li>
  <li>If “Jinzo” or “Royal Decree” is on the field, “Destiny Board’s effect will be negated and you cannot place a Spirit Message on the field. Also if one of the Spirit Messages or “Destiny Board” is destroyed while “Jinzo” or “Royal Decree” is on the field, the others will NOT be destroyed. If “Jinzo” is destroyed in the End Phase you may activate “Destiny Board”’s effect afterwards.</li>
  <li>“Cold Wave” will prevent the effect of “Destiny Board” to bring a Spirit Message to the field for the turn “Cold Wave” is activated.</li>
  <li>The placing of a Spirit Message on the field by the effect of “Destiny Board” cannot be negated with “Magic Jammer”, “Magic Drain”, “Solemn Judgment”, etc.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Can you activate “Dice Re-Roll” in response to your opponent rolling a die?<br />
A: “Dice Re-roll” does not care why the dice roll was performed, either offensive or defensive. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If an Archfiend monster is targeted by “Change of Heart” when is the proper time to activate “Dice Re-Roll”?<br />
A: You would activate “Dice Re-roll” in response to the “Change of Heart.” You would not wait until the Archfiend die roll. If you wait that long then you will already be resolving the chain, and at that point it would be too late to activate the “Dice Re-roll.” Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If “Dice Re-Roll’s” effect is used for the flip of “Dice Jar”, can you decide to re-roll your own and leave your opponent’s die roll?<br />
A: BOTH players would have to re-roll the die. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>

But, if your opponent activates “Ring of Destruction” AFTER “Diffusion Wave-Motion” resolves (with no chain), and the selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster is destroyed, your other monsters CANNOT attack.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates “Amazoness Archers” when your selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster attacks, only the Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster can attack because of “Diffusion Wave-Motion”’s effect, so your other monsters do not attack, but the -500 ATK effect of “Amazoness Archers” is still applied to all of your monsters.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon a monster during the Battle Phase after having activated “Diffusion Wave-Motion” (such as with “De-Fusion” or “Call of the Haunted”), that monster cannot attack because “Diffusion Wave-Motion”’s effect prevents all monsters other than the selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster from attacking.</li>
  <li>Your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with “Diffusion Wave-Motion” must attack each monster on your opponent’s side of the field, 1 at a time.</li>
  <li>After destroying all of your opponent’s monsters, your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster cannot then attack your opponent’s Life Points directly.</li>
  <li>If your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with “Diffusion Wave-Motion” has 1 of its attacks negated by “Magic Cylinder”, that attack is negated but your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster still attacks everything else.</li>
  <li>If your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light-Tryce” is selected with “Diffusion Wave-Motion”, if it has attacked 2 different monsters using “Diffusion Wave-Motion”’s effect, it no longer gets the second attack from “Twin Swords of Flashing Light-Tryce”’s effect because it has already attacked twice.</li>
  <li>If an opponent’s monster is equipped with “Ring of Magnetism”, your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with “Diffusion Wave-Motion” must attack that monster. If the monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” is not destroyed (such as if it is also equipped with “Heart of Clear Water”), you cannot attack any of your opponent’s other monsters.</li>

  <li>You can activate “Injection Fairy Lily”’s effect when she is attacked by a Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with “Diffusion Wave-Motion” because her effect is applied during damage calculation.</li>
  <li>When a Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with “Diffusion Wave-Motion” attacks “Spirit Reaper” or “Kisetai”, it cannot destroy “Spirit Reaper” or “Kisetai” (so “Kisetai”’s effect is not negated).</li>
  <li>A Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with “Diffusion Wave-Motion” will negate: the Flip Effects of a monster it destroys as a result of battle, or the effects of “Giant Rat”, “Sangan”, “Dark Necrofear”, “Sinister Serpent”, “D.D.

<h4 id="dimension-distortion">DIMENSION DISTORTION</h4>

<h4 id="disappear">DISAPPEAR</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a card that selects a card in the Graveyard as a target, such as “Monster Reborn”, “Mask of Darkness”, “Magician of Faith”, “Spear Cretin”, or “The Shallow Grave”, is activated, you may chain “Disappear” to remove the targeted card from play, and the “Monster Reborn”, etc., will resolve without effect. This is because these cards select their target at activation, not resolution.</li>
  <li>“Bazoo the Soul Eater” removes a monster in the Graveyard as a cost, so you cannot chain “Disappear” to the effect of “Bazoo the Soul Eater” to negate it. The monster is already removed from play before you can activate “Disappear”.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Disappear” to your opponent’s “Backup Soldier” you can remove one of the targeted monsters from play, but the remaining two (or less) go to the opponent’s hand.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="disc-fighter">DISC FIGHTER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You destroy a monster with “Disc Fighter”’s effect during the “calculate damage” portion but before the “apply damage” portion of damage calculation; which effectively means it’s right before the actual “damage calculation”.</li>
  <li>When “Disc Fighter” attacks a face-down monster, after it is flipped face-up you can use “Micro Ray” to cause the DEF to go below 2000, and the monster will not be destroyed by “Disc Fighter”’s effect. Or, you can use “The Reliable Guardian” to increase the DEF of a monster above 2000 so that it will be destroyed with “Disc Fighter”’s effect.</li>
  <li>The Defense Position monster is destroyed by “Disc Fighter”’s effect, not by damage calculation or “as a result of battle”.</li>
  <li>If “Final Attack Orders” is active, a monster attacked by “Disc Fighter” and flipped face-up will shift to Attack Position, so it will not be destroyed by “Disc Fighter”’s effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="divine-wrath">DIVINE WRATH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Divine Wrath” to a Flip Effect, Ignition Effect, Trigger Effect, or Multi-Trigger Effect. But not to a Continuous Effect. This is because Continuous Effects cannot be chained to.</li>
  <li>“Divine Wrath” is NOT a card that targets, so “Divine Wrath” may be used against Dragon-Type monsters while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Divine Wrath” against an effect monster’s effect that happens anywhere: on the field, in the hand, in the Graveyard, or removed from play.</li>
  <li>You must chain “Divine Wrath” to an effect directly preceeding it in the chain. For example, if “Airknight Parshath” equipped with “Cestus of Dagla” attacks a Defense Position monster, “Airknight Parshath” inflicts damage to the opponent’s Life Points during damage calculation. Then, during effect resolution, there are 2 simultaneous Trigger Effects that the controller places in a chain however he likes. If the effect of “Airknight Parshath” is Step 1 and “Cestus of Dagla” is Step 2, the opponent cannot chain “Divine Wrath”. However, if “Cestus of Dagla” is Step 1 and “Airknight Parshath” is Step 2, “Divine Wrath” can be chained. In this case, the effect of “Airknight Parshath” that allows the controller to draw a card is negated, “Airknight Parshath” is destroyed, and the effect of “Cestus of Dagla” disappears before it resolves.</li>
  <li>Another example: if “D.D. Warrior Lady” attacks a face-down “Morphing Jar”, and activates her effect to remove both cards from play, “D.D. Warrior Lady” is Step 2 because she has an optional effect, and “Morphing Jar” is Step 1 because its effect is mandatory. So “Divine Wrath” can be chained to the effect of “D.D. Warrior Lady” to negate its effect, but not to the effect of “Morphing Jar” to negate its effect.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the effect of “The Creator” (Ignition Effect), “Fox Fire” when it is Special Summoned (Trigger Effect), “Strike Ninja” (Multi-Trigger Effect), and “Homunculus the Alchemic Being” (Ignition Effect).</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” in a chain to a Trigger Effect that activates when the Effect Monster is Summoned such as “Breaker the Magical Warrior”, “Dark Magician of Chaos”, or “Marauding Captain”. The opponent must declare the activation of “Marauding Captain”’s effect before “Divine Wrath” can be activated. In this case, the monster that would have been Special Summoned remains in the opponent’s hand.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap, so you may activate it to negate the effect of “D.D. Warrior Lady”, “Reflect Bounder”, “Injection Fairy Lily”, “D.D. Crazy Beast”, “Dark Paladin”, or “Mystical Knight of Jackal”.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Divine Wrath” during the Damage Step to destroy the attacking monster or the monster being attacked, the monster is destroyed. No replay occurs because a replay can only happen during the Battle Step. If damage calculation has not been performed yet, it is not performed.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” against “Sasuke Samurai” or “Mystic Swordsman LV2” when they attack a face-down Defense Position monster.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” to negate either effect of “Don Zaloog” and to negate the effect of “Airknight Parshath” that allows its controller to draw a card.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” to negate an effect that activates in the Graveyard, such as “Witch of the Black Forest”, “Mystic Tomato”, “Despair from the Dark”, “Night Assailant”, “Electric Snake”, and “Sangan”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when the opponent discards “Kuriboh” from his / her hand to negate the effect of “Kuriboh” and when a “Night Assailant” is discarded to negate the effect of returning a Flip Effect monster to the owner’s hand.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Exiled Force”, “Red-Eyes B. Chick”, or “Paladin of White Dragon” is Tributed for its own effect.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Dark Necrofear” activates its effect in the Graveyard during the End Phase, and since a monster in the Graveyard cannot be destroyed, “Dark Necrofear” is not destroyed by a card effect, so its effect does not activate again.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the effect of “King Dragun” that Special summons a Dragon-Type monster.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when the opponent uses “Relinquished”’s effect to equip itself with a monster, or when “Relinquished”’s effect inflicts damage.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when a Spirit Monster is returned to the owner’s hand by its own effect, and the Spirit Monster will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when the effect of “Helpoemer” activates in the Graveyard, and the effect of “Helpoemer” will not activate again.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Vampire Lord” or “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” activate their effects in the Graveyard, and their effects are negated and they are not Special Summoned; but because they cannot be “destroyed” while in the Graveyard, they are not destroyed by a card effect so their effect will not activate again.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the activation of “Peten the Dark Clown”, and the effect of “Peten the Dark Clown” will not resolve (however, the “Peten the Dark Clown” that was removed from play remains out of play).</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when the effect of “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” activates that allows it to attack a second time.</li>
  <li>You cannot chain “Divine Wrath” to Continuous Effects such as: “Perfect Machine King”, “Raging Flame Sprite” (either effect), “Jinzo”, “Fire Princess”, “Mad Sword Beast”, “Hayabusa Knight”, “Cat’s Ear Tribe”, “Amazoness Swords Woman”, “Harpie Lady 3”, “Fusilier Dragon the Dual-Mode Beast”, “The Fiend Megacyber”, “Blade Knight” (either effect), “Patrician of Darkness”, or monsters like “Element Saurus” that gain ATK continuously.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Divine Wrath” when “Giant Orc”, “Goblin Attack Force”, or “Spear Dragon” changes to Defense Position because these are considered Continuous Effects.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Lava Golem” does damage to your Life Points, but you cannot activate it when “Lava Golem” is Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when any Union Monster activates its effect to equip itself to another monster, because that is an Ignition Effect. However, you cannot activate “Divine Wrath” when a Union Monster Special Summons itself back as a monster, because that is an effect of an Equip Spell Card.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when a “LV” monster is sent to the Graveyard to Special Summon the next level version (an Ignition Effect), and “Divine Wrath” will negate that effect, even though it cannot destroy the “LV” monster because it is already in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>After you negate the effect of “Sinister Serpent” with “Divine Wrath”, your opponent can activate the effect of “Sinister Serpent” again to return it to his hand, even during the same Standby Phase.</li>

  <li>You can destroy “Jinzo”, “Royal Decree”, “Tyrant Dragon”, “Sorcerer of Dark Magic”, “Fiend Skull Dragon”, and “The Dragon’s Bead” with this card’s effect.</li>
  <li>You cannot destroy “Ryu Senshi” because of its effect that prevents it from being targeted by a Spell Card.</li>
  <li>You cannot destroy “Reaper of the Cards” or “Trap Master” because they do not negate Trap Cards, they destroy Trap Cards.</li>
  <li>You can only destroy face-up cards with the effect of “Double Snare”. The opponent may chain “Book of Moon” to your “Double Snare” to flip his / her monster face-down, and it will not be destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="double-spell">DOUBLE SPELL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You select the card you are activating in your opponent’s Graveyard when you activate “Double Spell”. “Double Spell” can then be chained to after you announce your selection.</li>
  <li>The selected card itself CANNOT be chained to as you are in resolution of the chain at that point.</li>
  <li>If the selected Spell Card is Ritual, Normal, or Quick-Play (except for “Swords of Revealing Light”), it remains in your opponent’s Graveyard and is not placed on the field, so you only need 1 vacant Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone spot (for “Double Spell” itself) to activate “Double Spell”.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Double Spell” and select a Continuous, Field, or Equip Spell Card, or “Swords of Revealing Light”, you place the selected Spell Card in your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone, so you need 2 vacant Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone spots (1 for “Double Spell”, 1 for the selected card). The Continuous/Field/Equip/”Swords of Revealing Light” Spell Card then remains on the field as normal.</li>
  <li>The player who activates “Double Spell” pays any costs for the selected Spell Card (for “Delinquent Duo”, “Tribute to the Doomed”, etc.).</li>
  <li>You cannot select a Spell Card with “Double Spell” that cannot be activated, such as an Equip Spell Card when no monsters are on the field.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Double Spell” while “Necrovalley” is in effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: When activating “Double Spell”, will cards like “Skilled White Magician” or “Skilled Dark Magician” receive 1 or 2 Spell Counters?<br />
A: Only 1 Spell Counter. You get 1 Spell Counter for “Double Spell,” but not one for the targeted Spell Card because it is never activated. (The targeted Spell Card does its thing during the resolution of “Double Spell.”) Curtis Schultz, 04/07/2004</li>

  <li>The turn player selects a card first for “Dragged Down into the Grave”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Appropriate” in response to “Dragged Down into the Grave” because drawing was the last thing performed.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Dragon-Type monsters on both sides of the field are affected by “Dragon Capture Jar”.</li>

</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<h4 id="dragon-manipulator">DRAGON MANIPULATOR</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Dragon Manipulator” may only target a face-up Dragon Type monster.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="dragons-mirror">DRAGON’S MIRROR</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer” is on your opponent’s side of the field, you can activate “Dragon’s Mirror” if all the Fusion Material Monsters are on the field; however, if any of them are in the Graveyard, you cannot activate it.</li>

<h4 id="dragons-rage">DRAGON’S RAGE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you attack with “Spear Dragon” or a Dragon-Type monster equipped with “Fairy Meteor Crush”, the difference between your monster’s ATK and the attacked monster’s DEF will only be inflicted as Battle Damage once. The effect of “Dragon’s Rage” will not inflict the damage again.</li>
  <li>Netrep Rulings:</li>
  <li>“Dragon’s Rage” does not specifically designate a target.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dragonic-attack">DRAGONIC ATTACK</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “DNA Surgery” and “Dragonic Attack” are both active, the latter one to resolve takes precedence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Dragonic Attack” is equipped to a Warrior-Type monster changing it to Dragon-Type, would “Lord of D.” negate the effect of “Dragonic Attack” and destroy it?<br />
A: The effect of “Dragonic Attack” would still be applied. “Lord of D.” has no affect on effects that targeted a Dragon-Type monster before “Lord of D.” was on the field. This would include the Warrior-Type that becomes a Dragon-Type because of “Dragonic Attack.” Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</li>

<h4 id="dramatic-rescue">DRAMATIC RESCUE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can activate “Dramatic Rescue” when an Amazoness on your side of the field is targeted, such as with any Equip Spell Card, “Tribute to the Doomed”, “Trap Hole”, “Man-Eater Bug”, “Relinquished”, “Dark Cat with White Tail”, “Amazoness Spellcaster”, “Penguin Soldier” (even if it targets 2 monsters), “Change of Heart”, “Ring of Destruction”, “XYZ Dragon Cannon”, etc. But not when cards like “Raigeki”, “Dark Hole”, “Mirror Force”, “Fissure”, “Creature Swap”, “Guardian Sphinx”, “Bottomless Trap Hole”, “Adhesive Trap Hole”, etc. are used.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Dramatic Rescue” when your face-down Amazoness is targeted (with “Nobleman of Crossout”, etc.).</li>
  <li>You can activate “Dramatic Rescue” when your opponent’s Amazoness controlled by you is targeted; in this case, the Amazoness returns to your opponent’s hand but it is you (the player who activated “Dramatic Rescue”) that gets to Special Summon a monster.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Dramatic Rescue” and your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” and destroys the Amazoness, the Amazoness does not return to your hand and “Dramatic Rescue”’s effect disappears (so no monster is Special Summoned).</li>
  <li>If you have no monster to Special Summon, you cannot activate “Dramatic Rescue”.</li>
  <li>You cannot Special Summon the Monster Card that you returned to your hand with “Dramatic Rescue”, but if you have a second copy of that monster in your hand you may Special Summon the second copy.</li>
  <li>You can Special Summon high-level monsters with “Dramatic Rescue” but not “Special Summon-only” monsters.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Amazoness Spellcaster”, and chain “Dramatic Rescue”, “Amazoness Spellcaster”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates “Snatch Steal” to take control of your Amazoness, and you chain “Dramatic Rescue”, “Snatch Steal”’s effect disappears.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Dramatic Rescue” may not be activated in response to an attack.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dreamsprite">DREAMSPRITE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Dreamsprite” is not optional so if you have at least 1 other monster on the field when “Dreamsprite” is attacked, the attack target is changed to your other monster. This is also true if “Dreamsprite” is attacked when face-down.</li>
  <li>If your “Dreamsprite” equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” is chosen as an attack target, and you control another monster, the effect of “Dreamsprite” will still change the attack target to your other monster.</li>
  <li>If you control “Dreamsprite”, “The Legendary Fisherman”, and “Umi” is on the field, “Dreamsprite”’s effect can still change an attack target to “The Legendary Fisherman” because he is not being targeted with an attack, but is being targeted with a monster effect.</li>
  <li>If you control two “Dreamsprites” and one is attacked, you cannot continue to switch the attack target between the two “Dreamsprites” because the effect of “Dreamsprite” says that you must calculate damage on the new target.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="drill-bug">DRILL BUG</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A player may not choose a face-up “Parasite Paracide” in his or her Deck.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="drillago">DRILLAGO</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If there are Spell or Trap Cards, or face-down monsters, on your opponent’s side of the field, “Drillago” cannot attack directly.</li>
  <li>If “Drillago” attacks directly, and your opponent activates an effect to reduce one of his face-up monsters to less than 1600 ATK, there is no longer a condition allowing “Drillago” to attack directly, and a replay occurs.</li>
  <li>If “Drillago” attacks directly, and your opponent activates “Ready for Intercepting” from his hand, because his/her “Makyura the Destructor” was sent to the Graveyard earlier this turn, to flip one of his face-up monsters face-down, there is no longer a condition allowing “Drillago” to attack directly, and a replay occurs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: When I attack with “Drillago” and all my opponent has on the field is “Injection Fairy Lily,” if he raises the ATK to 3400, can I attack him directly?<br />
A: You declare your attack during the Battle Step. “Injection Fairy Lily” is a 400 attack monster at the time, so “Drillago” would not be to use its effect and declare a direct attack. “Drillago” decides to attack the “Injection Fairy Lily.” Even if the effect of the “Injection Fairy Lily” is activated in the Damage Step, “Drillago” will not be able to change to a direct attack. “Drillago” will continue battling with the “Injection Fairy Lily” and damage calculation will occur. Curtis Schultz, 03/08/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="drillroid">DRILLROID</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Drillroid” can use its effect to destroy face-up and face-down Defense Position monsters that it attacks.</li>
  <li>Note that “Drillroid” does not say “without flipping the monster face-up”. The effect of “Drillroid” is applied after the monster is flipped face-up, but before damage calculation. If the Defense Position monster was face-down and has a Flip Effect, the Flip Effect will activate and resolve normally.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Drillroid” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks a face-up “Sasuke Samurai #4”, do the coin toss for “Sasuke Samurai #4” first, at the beginning of the Damage Step. If “Sasuke Samurai #4” destroys “Drillroid” with its effect, the effect of “Drillroid” is not applied. (If “Sasuke Samurai #4” was face-down, then you miss the chance to use its effect.)</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks “Dreamsprite”, both are mandatory Trigger Effects with the same timing, so they form a chain with “Dreamsprite” as Chain Link 2. “Dreamsprite” resolves first and, according to her effect, causes damage calculation to happen immediately. Since the effect of “Drillroid” only happens without damage calculation, the effect of “Drillroid” disappears.</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks a Defense Position “D.D. Warrior Lady”, the effect of “D.D. Warrior Lady” does not activate, because she has been destroyed by the effect of “Drillroid” by the time her effect would normally activate.</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks a face-down Defense Position monster while “Final Attack Orders” is active, the monster is not destroyed because it flips face-up and immediately shifts to Attack Position.</li>
  <li>“Nightmare Penguin” will activate its effect if attacked by “Drillroid” while face-down. (Just like a Flip Effect.)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="driving-snow">DRIVING SNOW</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Driving Snow” may be activated only after a Trap Card is destroyed. “Driving Snow” may not be activated in a chain with an effect that would destroy a Trap Card.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="drop-off">DROP OFF</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The card discarded by the effect of “Drop Off” is considered to be discarded from your hand, not your Deck. If “Penguin Knight” is the card discarded, its effect will not activate. If “Electric Snake”, “Regenerating Mummy”, or “Fear from the Dark” is the card discarded, its effect will activate.</li>
  <li>This card is activated during the opponent’s Draw Phase in response to the opponent drawing a card. It is not chained to the draw.</li>
  <li>If a Quick-Play Spell Card is drawn, the opponent may activate it in a chain to “Drop Off” and the effect of “Drop Off” will disappear since the drawn card is no longer in the opponent’s hand.</li>
  <li>If the fifth and final piece of Exodia is drawn, the opponent wins before the effect of “Drop Off” is resolved.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dummy-golem">DUMMY GOLEM</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Dummy Golem” is attacked, flipped, and destroyed by damage calculation, its effect is not applied because it is destroyed. So control does not switch.</li>
  <li>If an effect like “Ring of Destruction” is chained to the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, destroying “Dummy Golem”, the effect of “Dummy Golem” disappears.</li>
  <li>If the opponent only has one monster, and it is “Blindly Loyal Goblin” or “Mataza the Zapper”, and you activate the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, the effect does activate and can be chained to, however its effect disappears because control of “Blindly Loyal Goblin” cannot switch.</li>
  <li>If the opponent has “Blindly Loyal Goblin” and “Gemini Elf” on the field, and you activate the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, the opponent cannot select “Blindly Loyal Goblin”. They must select “Gemini Elf”.</li>
  <li>If control of monsters switches with “Dummy Golem”, it stays switched as long as the cards remain on the field. (Like “Creature Swap”.)</li>
  <li>The effect of “Dummy Golem” will NOT resolve if any of the following is true: (1) “Dummy Golem” is not on the field when the effect resolves; (2) “Dummy Golem” has been destroyed before the effect resolves, such as by damage calculation; (3) there is no opponent’s monster when the effect resolves, such as if it was returned to the hand with “Compulsory Evacuation Device”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dust-barrier">DUST BARRIER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you skip your second Standby Phase with “Solomon’s Lawbook”, etc., then “Dust Barrier” remains on the field and its effect continues to apply.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” is active during the 2nd Standby Phase after activation, “Dust Barrier” is still destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dust-tornado">DUST TORNADO</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card on your opponent’s side of the field to be able to Set 1 Spell or Trap Card. If your opponent chains a card to destroy the target of “Dust Tornado”, you cannot then Set a Spell or Trap Card because “Dust Tornado” did not destroy a Spell or Trap Card. If your opponent activates the card targeted by “Dust Tornado” it is not negated, but is still destroyed by “Dust Tornado” so you may Set 1 Spell or Trap Card.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A non Quick-play Spell Card set by the effect of “Dust Tornado” during that player’s Turn may be activated during that player’s Main Phase 1 or Main Phase 2.</li>
  <li>If “Dust Tornado” is chained to “Harpies’ Feather Duster” or “Heavy Storm,” and “Dust Tornado’s” second effect of Setting a Spell or Trap Card is used, that Spell or Trap card will be subject to the effect of “Harpie’s Feather Duster” or “Heavy Storm.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="eagle-eye">EAGLE EYE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of this monster prevents the activation of Trap Cards that can be activated when a monster is Normal Summoned, such as “Trap Hole” and “Torrential Tribute”.</li>
  <li>You can activate Trap Cards later in the turn.</li>
  <li>You can negate the Normal Summon of this monsters with “Horn of Heaven” or “Solemn Judgment”. (In which case the Normal Summon failed and the effect of the monster is not applied.)</li>
  <li>The effect of this monster is applied to both players (so you cannot activate “Pineapple Blast” in response to your Normal Summon of this monster).</li>
  <li>This is a Continuous Effect that you cannot chain to.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="earth-chant">EARTH CHANT</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<h4 id="ebon-magician-curran">EBON MAGICIAN CURRAN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Ebon Magician Curran” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.</li>
  <li>Count the number of monsters on the opponent’s side of the field when you resolve the effect of “Ebon Magician Curran”, not when it activates.</li>
  <li>If “Ebon Magician Curran” is Special Summoned during the Standby Phase while “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field, both Trigger Effects activate immediately and form a chain.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ectoplasmer">ECTOPLASMER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Ectoplasmer” causes the turn player to Tribute during his/her End Phase, but the opponent does not Tribute. So while “Ectoplasmer” is out, I Tribute in my End Phase, and you Tribute in your End Phase. But I don’t Tribute in yours and you don’t Tribute in mine.</li>
  <li>So 1 Tribute is performed during the End Phase of each player’s turn. The Tribute is performed by the turn player. (Both players have to do this during their respective End Phases, not just the controller of “Ectoplasmer”.)</li>
  <li>Tributing a monster for “Ectoplasmer” is not a cost, it’s an effect, so you can’t Tribute monsters unaffected by Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>If you have a face-up monster on your side of the field during the End Phase, you have to Tribute for “Ectoplasmer”’s effect.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Mystical Space Typhoon” or “Raigeki Break” to “Ectoplasmer”’s effect, and if there is no “Ectoplasmer” on the field, then its effect is not applied.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Soul Exchange” during your Main Phase and use its effect to Tribute your opponent’s monster for “Ectoplasmer” during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If you Tribute your opponent’s monster that you controlled with “Snatch Steal” or “Change of Heart”, your opponent takes the damage even though it was their monster.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ekibyo-drakmord">EKIBYO DRAKMORD</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” was active during the end of the second turn, a monster equipped with “Ekibyo Drakmord” will not be destroyed and “Ekibyo Drakmord” will remain equipped to it.</li>
  <li>If control of a monster equipped with “Ekibyo Drakmord” changes, the turn count resets. If “Ekibyo Drakmord” is moved by “Collected Power” or “Tailor of the Fickle” to another monster, the turn count resets.</li>
  <li>If “Ekibyo Drakmord” is no longer on the field, a previously equipped monster will not be destroyed on the 2nd turn after “Ekibyo Drakmord” was played.</li>
  <li>If “Ekibyo Drakmord” is equipped to “The Legendary Fisherman” and then “Umi” is activated, “Ekibyo Drakmord” will remain meaninglessly equipped to “The Legendary Fisherman”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Heart of Clear Water” is equipped to a monster equipped with “Ekibyo Drakmord” when “Ekibyo Drakmord” would destroy the monster, “Heart of Clear Water” will prevent the monster from being destroyed. “Ekibyo Drakmord” will remain equipped to the monster and the equipped monster will not be allowed to attack.</li>

<ul>
  <li>If a FIRE and a WIND monster are on the field, you get both effects.</li>
  <li>If there are 2 FIRE monsters on the field, Element Dragon’s ATK is 2000 (it only gets the +500 ATK bonus once, no matter how many FIRE monsters are on the field).</li>
  <li>If there is only 1 WIND monster on the field, and you attack and destroy it with “Element Dragon”, you cannot attack again because there is no longer a WIND monster on the field so “Element Dragon” no longer has that ability.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have their Attribute changed with “DNA Transplant” or “Scroll of Bewitchment” are included for “Element Dragon”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If there are no face-up FIRE monsters on the field, and “Element Dragon” attacks a face-down FIRE monster, “Element Dragon”’s effect that increases its ATK by 500 points is applied before damage calculation because it is a Continuous Effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="element-soldier">ELEMENT SOLDIER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If both a WATER and an EARTH monster are on the field, you get both effects.</li>
  <li>If the only EARTH monster on the field is your opponent’s “Giant Rat”, and your “Element Soldier” attacks and destroys it, there is no EARTH monster on the field when “Giant Rat”’s effect activates in the Graveyard, so “Element Soldier” no longer has the ability to negate monster effects and “Giant Rat”’s effect resolves as normal. (Monsters destroyed by “Element Soldier” that have effects that activate in the Graveyard will only have their effects negated if an EARTH monster is on the field at the time the monster is sent to the Graveyard.)</li>
  <li>If there are no face-up EARTH monsters on the field, and “Element Soldier” attacks a face-down “Man-Eater Bug”, it is flipped up, and there is now an EARTH monster on the field when “Man-Eater Bug”’s effect would activate and resolve. So “Element Soldier” negates “Man-Eater Bug”’s effect.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have their Attribute changed with “DNA Transplant” or “Scroll of Bewitchment” are included for “Element Soldier”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If “Element Soldier” destroys “Sinister Serpent” while there is an EARTH monster on the field, “Sinister Serpent” cannot be added to your hand even if “Element Soldier” is removed from the field or loses its ability later on because there is no longer an EARTH monster.</li>

  <li>If you choose not to draw 2 cards for “Elemental Hero Bubbleman’s” effect, it does not start a chain.</li>

  <li>If you Special Summon “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” by the effect of your opponent’s “Last Turn”, you can draw the 2 cards.</li>
  <li>If your opponent chains to the effect of “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” with an effect that causes you to have cards in your hand (such as “Conscription”), then the effect of “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” disappears because you must still have no cards when resolving the effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="elemental-hero-flame-wingman">ELEMENTAL HERO FLAME WINGMAN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The damage inflicted by the effect of “Elemental Hero Flame Wingman” is based on the ATK of the destroyed monster in the Graveyard. So it’s the original ATK of the monster.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” targets a monster. Discarding a card for this effect is a cost. This effect can be chained to.</li>
  <li>If a monster is equipped with “Megamorph” and its ATK is lower than that of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant”, and the effect is activated to destroy the equipped monster, but “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to destroy “Megamorph”, so that the monster’s original ATK is now higher than the ATK of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant”, the effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” disappears and the monster is not destroyed.</li>
  <li>Likewise, if the effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” is activated, targeting “King of the Skull Servants” with 2000 original ATK, and the opponent chains “Curse of Aging” and discards “Skull Servant” to activate it, then “King of the Skull Servants” has 3000 original ATK and is not destroyed.</li>

  <li>The effect of “Elemental Mistress Doriado” is even applied while she’s in your hand or Graveyard. So you can discard her for the effect of “Abyss Soldier”. Or remove her from play while in the Graveyard to Special Summon “Gigantes”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Fuh-Rin-Ka-Zan” if “Elemental Mistress Doriado” is on the field (no other monsters are required).</li>
  <li>“Elemental Burst” requires 4 Tributes. “Elemental Mistress Doriado” can be used as 1 of the 4, but you will still need to Tribute 3 other monsters of the appropriate Attributes.</li>
  <li>If “Scroll of Bewitchment” or “DNA Transplant” changes the Attribute of “Elemental Mistress Doriado”, her Attribute becomes that Attribute only. (Her effect is not applied.)</li>
  <li>If destroyed in battle by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, the effect of “Elemental Mistress Doriado” in the Graveyard is NOT negated because it is a condition as well as an effect.</li>

<h4 id="embodiment-of-apophis">EMBODIMENT OF APOPHIS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once “Embodiment of Apophis” has been activated, it takes up 1 Monster Card Zone and 1 Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone. The physical location of “Embodiment of Apophis” should be on the Monster Card Zones, however.</li>
  <li>If your Monster Card Zones are all full you cannot activate “Embodiment of Apophis”. If your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zones are all full you cannot take control of your opponent’s “Embodiment of Apophis” because you will need 1 Monster Card Zone and 1 Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone for it.</li>
  <li>If your opponent has no vacant Spell &amp; Trap Card Zones, you cannot give them “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Creature Swap”. If “Embodiment of Apophis” is your only monster in such a case, neither player can activate “Creature Swap”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Embodiment of Apophis” during your opponent’s Main Phase, or your own.</li>
  <li>While “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, it is still treated as a Trap Card and can be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.</li>
  <li>If an effect that destroys Trap Cards is used against “Embodiment of Apophis”, you can use “Fake Trap” to prevent it from being destroyed. When preventing the destruction of “Embodiment of Apophis”, you must be using a card of the appropriate type. You cannot use “My Body as a Shield” to rescue it from “Heavy Storm”. You cannot use “Fake Trap” to rescue it from “Raigeki”. You can use “Riryoku Field” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is targeted by “Snatch Steal”, but not when it’s targeted by “Mystical Space Typhoon”. You can use any of these effects to protect “Embodiment of Apophis” from “Raigeki Break” because “Raigeki Break” can destroy a Monster card or a Trap Card.</li>
  <li>vs. “Jinzo”: If “Emodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and “Jinzo” or “Royal Decree” is played, “Embodiment of Apophis” cannot remain as a monster and is placed face-up in the Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone, where it remains on the field meaninglessly (even if “Jinzo” leaves play later). If “Royal Decree” is chained to the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis”, the effect of “Embodiment of Apophis” is negated and it remains on the field in the Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” attacks a face-down “Jinzo”, once “Jinzo” is flipped face-up, “Embodiment of Apophis” reverts to a Trap Card. Damage calculation is not applied.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is flipped face-down, it goes back to the Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone as a Trap Card (vertically, since Trap Cards do not have battle positions). You cannot activate “Embodiment of Apophis” that same turn, because it is a Trap Card that was just Set.</li>
  <li>When “Embodiment of Apophis” is sent to the Graveyard, it is sent as a Trap Card and remains treated as a Trap Card. You cannot revive it with “Monster Reborn” or retrieve it with “Return of the Doomed”. It will not trigger “Last Will”. You cannot activate “Michizure”. It will not be Special Summoned by “Red-Moon Baby”. No damage is inflicted by “KA-2 Des Scissors” or “Inferno” or “Fatal Abacus”. “Emes the Infinity” does not increase its ATK. No Life Points are increased by “Absorbing Kid from the Sky”. You would not gain Life Points for “Altar for Tribute”. (You can, however, now add it back to your hand with “Mask of Darkness”.)</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal” or “Creature Swap”, and it is flipped face-down, it goes to your opponent’s Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone because he is the controller.</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal”, and “Jinzo” is Summoned, it returns to your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone and remains there meaninglessly. If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster because of “Creature Swap”, and “Jinzo” is Summoned, it is placed on your opponent’s Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone and remains there meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>“Embodiment of Apophis” is considered a Normal Monster. It does not inflict damage for “Ceasefire”. You can use “Delta Attacker” if you have 3 “Embodiment of Apophis” monsters. You can Tribute “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Sword of the Soul-Eater” while it is a monster.</li>
  <li>If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, “Embodiment of Apophis” cannot be destroyed by “Raigeki”, etc., but can still be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.</li>
  <li>“Embodiment of Apophis”, while a monster, has original ATK 1600 and original DEF 1800 (for purposes of “Megamorph”, etc.).</li>
  <li>You can negate the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis” by chaining “Solemn Judgment” or “7 Tools of the Bandit” or “Royal Oppression”, but you cannot use these against it once it is a monster.</li>
  <li>When “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, you can activate “Torrential Tribute” just like with any other Summon.</li>
  <li>You can use “Chain Destruction” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” will destroy all copies of “Embodiment of Apophis” in the hand and Deck even though they are Trap Cards.</li>
  <li>You can use “Embodiment of Apophis” as a Tribute once it is a monster. You cannot Tribute it for a Ritual Summon, etc., while it is in your hand.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and “Morphing Jar #2” is activated, “Embodiment of Apophis” is shuffled into the Deck as a Trap Card, so it does NOT count towards the number of monsters you need to pick up. (Also, if you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for the effect of “Morphing Jar #2”, it is not counted as a monster and will be one of the cards sent to the Graveyard.)</li>
  <li>If you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Cyber Jar”, it is added to your hand.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and is equipped to “Relinquished”, “Embodiment of Apophis” is treated as any other monster equipped to “Relinquished”, and “Relinquished” gets 1600 ATK and 1800 DEF.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, “Giant Trunade” will still return it to the owner’s hand.</li>
  <li>When “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is returned to the hand by “Penguin Soldier”, etc., it is returned as a Trap Card. So you cannot activate “Major Riot”.</li>
  <li>You can target “Embodiment of Apophis” with “Monster Recovery” while it is a monster, and return it to the Deck.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and you use “Magical Hats” with it, it returns to your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone face-down. The other effects of “Magical Hats” apply normally.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” battles “D.D. Warrior Lady” and her effect is activated, both will be removed from play.</li>
  <li>If you select “Embodiment of Apophis” as your monster for “Last Turn”, it is not sent to the Graveyard even though “Last Turn” sends all other cards to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If you control “Theban Nightmare” and “Embodiment of Apophis”, you control a Trap Card so the effect of “Theban Nightmare” cannot be applied.</li>
  <li>If you change “Embodiment of Apophis” to Machine-Type and use “Limiter Removal”, then “Jinzo” is Summoned later that turn and “Embodiment of Apophis” switches back to a Trap Card, “Embodiment of Apophis” is not destroyed in the End Phase by “Limiter Removal”.</li>
  <li>If you use “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” against “Embodiment of Apophis”, it returns to the field as a Trap Card and is destroyed immediately. If “Dimensionhole” was used, you cannot use the Monster Card Zone while “Embodiment of Apophis” is removed from play, but you can use the Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone it was occupying.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="emergency-provisions">EMERGENCY PROVISIONS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sending Spell and Trap Cards on your side of the field to the Graveyard is a cost for activating this card.</li>
  <li>You can activate a Normal Spell Card, such as “Raigeki”, then chain “Emergency Provisions” and send “Raigeki” to the Graveyard to gain 1000 Life Points, and the effect of “Raigeki” will still resolve.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates “Heavy Storm” you can chain “Emergency Provisions” to send your Spell and Trap Cards to Graveyard first (and gain the appropriate amount of Life Points).</li>
  <li>You gain the Life Points from this card’s effect in one lump sum, so if you control “Fire Princess” her effect will only inflict 500 points of damage.</li>
  <li>The effect of this card does not “destroy” your Spell and Trap Cards; it “sends them to the Graveyard.” So, for example, you may send a Spell Card to the Graveyard with a counter on it from “Magic Reflector”. You can also send “Fusion Sword Murasame Blade” even though it cannot be “destroyed”.</li>
  <li>If you control a monster equipped with “Premature Burial” and you send “Premature Burial” to the Graveyard to activate “Emergency Provisions” the equipped monster is not destroyed, because “Premature Burial” was not destroyed. The same is true for Toon Monsters: if you send “Toon World” to the Graveyard with “Emergency Provisions”, Toon Monsters you control are not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you send “Smoke Grenade of the Thief” or “Blast with Chain” to the Graveyard for the cost of “Emergency Provisions” their effects do not activate, because they were not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you send “Black Pendant” to the Graveyard for the cost of “Emergency Provisions” its effect does activate.</li>
  <li>While “Banisher of the Light” is face-up on the field, you cannot activate “Emergency Provisions” since it is impossible to send cards to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If you have “Imperial Order” active on your side of the field, you may send it to the Graveyard as part of the cost to activate “Emergency Provisions” and “Emergency Provisions” will not be negated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="emissary-of-the-afterlife">EMISSARY OF THE AFTERLIFE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If neither player has a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster in their Deck, the effect of “Emissary of the Afterlife” disappears BUT both players get to look at their opponent’s Decks before they are shuffled.</li>
  <li>If only 1 player as a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster in their Deck, then that player gets to add the monster to his hand.</li>
  <li>You select monsters when the effect resolves. The effect of “Emissary of the Afterlife” does not target.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="emissary-of-the-oasis">EMISSARY OF THE OASIS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Emissary of the Oasis”’ last sentence applies even when your opponent attacks with a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster; the Battle Damage to you becomes zero.</li>
  <li>If you have “Emissary of the Oasis” with “Raregold Armor”, and a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster, your opponent cannot attack.</li>
  <li>A Monster Token is a Normal Monster, but a Ritual Monster without an effect is not a Normal Monster.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="enchanted-javelin">ENCHANTED JAVELIN</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="enchanting-fitting-room">ENCHANTING FITTING ROOM</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have no vacant monster zones, you cannot Special Summon with “Enchanting Fitting Room”. So the Level 3 or lower Normal Monsters that would be Special Summoned are sent to the Graveyard instead. All other cards are still returned to the Deck and it is shuffled.</li>
  <li>If you have some vacant Monster Card Zones, but not enough, select the monsters you wish to Summon with “Enchanting Fitting Room” and Special Summon them.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="enemy-controller">ENEMY CONTROLLER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can activate “Enemy Controller”’s first effect even if you have no monster on your side of the field.</li>
  <li>If you activate either of “Enemy Controller”’s effects, and your opponent chains “Book of Moon” to flip the target monster face-down, its targeting conditions are no longer correct when “Enemy Controller” resolves and “Enemy Controller”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>The monster you Tribute for “Enemy Controller” is a cost.</li>
  <li>When the Ignition Effect of “Cannon Soldier” or “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End” is activated, and you chain “Enemy Controller” to take control of the “Cannon Soldier”/”Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, even if you take control of the monster, you cannot take control of the effect itself. So if your opponent activates “Cannon Soldier” or “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”’s effect, and you chain “Enemy Controller”, you still take the damage from “Cannon Soldier”/”Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”.</li>
  <li>If “Dark Magician of Chaos” is Summoned, and you chain “Enemy Controller” to the activation of his effect, even if you take control of “Dark Magician of Chaos”, you cannot take control of his effect, so the Summoner (the activator of the effect) gets to retrieve 1 Spell Card from the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When “Spirit of the Pharaoh” is Special Summoned, and “Enemy Controller” is chained to the effect, the player who Special Summoned “Spirit of the Pharaoh” gets the effect because he activated the effect.</li>
  <li>If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Enemy Controller”, and then the monster is flipped face-down with “Book of Moon”, control of the monster is still returned to the opponent (the original controller) during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Enemy Controller”, and then the monster is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”, when it returns to play it comes to the side of the field of the player who used “Enemy Controller”, but then immediately moves back to the original Controller.</li>
  <li>If your opponent Normal Summons “Breaker the Magical Warrior”, “Breaker the Magical Warrior”’s effect to place a Spell Counter on him activates, and you chain “Enemy Controller” to that effect and take control of “Breaker the Magical Warrior”. In that case, resolve “Enemy Controller” first and “Breaker the Magical Warrior”’s effect of placing a Spell Counter second.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="energy-drain">ENERGY DRAIN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Hayabusa Knight”, boosted by “Energy Drain”, attacks, and the opponent’s hand is reduced during the battle, the ATK of “Hayabusa Knight” for the second attack is not changed because the effect of “Energy Drain” is determined when “Energy Drain” resolves.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For “Enraged Battle Ox”’s effect to activate, the attacked monster must be in Defense Position during damage calculation. So if “Final Attack Orders” is active, “Enraged Battle Ox”’s effect will not be applied.</li>

<h4 id="eria-the-water-charmer">ERIA THE WATER CHARMER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>If you take control of the opponent’s monster with a “Charmer” and the opponent takes control back with “Change of Heart”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Change of Heart” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).</li>
  <li>If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.</li>
  <li>If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.</li>
  <li>If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.</li>
  <li>If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.</li>

  <li>“Exiled Force” has an activated effect and is Spell Speed 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Since “Exiled Force” can be summoned and tributed before the opponent can respond with something other than negating “Exiled Force,” can you chain “Torrential Tribute” to the effect of “Exiled Force?”<br />
A: Yes you may. bishop, 12/15/2003</li>
  <li>Q: Can “Exiled Force” be the target of its own effect?<br />
A: No. When you activate the effect of “Exiled Force” you offer it as a Tribute. It will no longer be on the field to target with its effect. Curtis Schultz, 01/17/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If “Exiled Force” is summoned to the field while there is a face-up “King Tiger Wanghu”, will the controller be able to activate the effect of “Exiled Force” before it is destroyed by the effect of “King Tiger Wanghu”?<br />
A: This is similar to “Exiled Force” and “Mysterious Puppeteer.” The effect of “King Tiger Wanghu” will activate automatically when “Exiled Force” is summoned. Due to this, “Exiled Force” will not be able to activate its effect. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exodia-necross">EXODIA NECROSS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Exodia Necross” cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of “Contract with Exodia”. So “Exodia Necross” cannot be Special Summoned with “Monster Reborn”, etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.</li>
  <li>Players can activate Spell &amp; Trap Card effects that destroy monsters, but “Exodia Necross” will not be destroyed by them.</li>

  <li>If your opponent takes control of your “Exodia Necross” and does not have all 5 pieces of Exodia in his/her Graveyard, “Exodia Necross” is destroyed if face-up.</li>
  <li>While “Skill Drain” is active, “Exodia Necross”’ ATK is returned to its original 1800 points. Even if “Skill Drain” then leaves play, “Exodia Necross” does no regain any ATK increases it had because of its effect, but it will begin to accumulate ATK points again.</li>
  <li>While “Skill Drain” is active, “Exodia Necross” is not destroyed if Exodia pieces are removed from the Graveyard, but it will be destroyed if the effect of “Skill Drain” disappears.</li>

<h4 id="fairy-box">FAIRY BOX</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have two copies of “Fairy Box” active on the field you may flip a coin twice, but only need to call 1 correctly to reduce the attacking monster’s ATK to 0.</li>
  <li>The current ATK is reduced to 0, including all Equip Spell Cards. Trap Cards and Quick-Play Spell Cards cannot further increase the monster’s ATK this battle. A monster effect such as “Injection Fairy Lily” can increase its own ATK after “Fairy Box” is successful.</li>
  <li>Paying 500 Life Points is optional, if you choose not to pay “Fairy Box” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Fairy Box” does not target, so “Lord of D.” will not prevent “Fairy Box” from reducing the ATK of an attacking Dragon-Type monster to 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: When does “Fairy Box” set ATK to 0? If “Mirage Knight” were to attack a monster, or “Injection Fairy Lily” were to use its effect, would that boost be added to the set value of 0, or would the ATK value be set to 0 after all modifiers?<br />
A: The ATK is set during the Battle Step. “Injection Fairy Lily” can have its ATK increased by its effect during the Damage Step. “Fairy Box” would not lower it again. This goes for “Mirage Knight” as well. Curtis Schultz, 04/15/2004</li>

  <li>If you equip your “Fairy Meteor Crush” to an opponent’s monster, and it attacks a Defense Position monster on your side of the field with ATK greater than your monster’s DEF, the opponent will take the difference as Battle Damage. This is because “your opponent” is the opponent of the player who controls “Fairy Meteor Crush” not necessarily the opponent of the player who controls the monster.</li>

<h4 id="falling-down">FALLING DOWN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>If there are no Archfiends on your side of the field, “Falling Down” is destroyed immediately, even in the middle of a chain.</li>
  <li>The Archfiend you need for “Falling Down” doesn’t have to be a monster. Cards like “Axe of Despair”, or an Archfiend monster equipped to your “Relinquished”, will prevent “Falling Down” from being destroyed.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Falling Down” when there are no Archfiends on your side of the field, but it is destroyed immediately before it is equipped to a monster.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Barrel Behind the Door” against the damage from “Falling Down” because you cannot use “Barrel Behind the Door” against a Continuous or Equip Spell Card.</li>

<h4 id="fatal-abacus">FATAL ABACUS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the effect of “Fatal Abacus” to trigger, a Monster Card that is being treated as a monster must be sent from the field to the Graveyard. This means that a Monster Card equipped to “Relinquished” or “Sword Hunter” that is sent to the Graveyard will not trigger this effect. Also, a Spell or Trap Card that is destroyed while being treated as a monster by the effect of “Magical Hats” will not trigger this effect.</li>
  <li>Monster Tokens do not trigger this card’s effect because they are not sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>Monsters that are removed from play and monsters that are destroyed while “Banisher of the Light” is on the field do not trigger this card’s effect. This is because they never go to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>“Sent from the field to the Graveyard” includes cards that are destroyed, Tributed, or sent straight from the field to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If multiple “Fatal Abacus” cards are active on the field, a player will take 500 points of damage for each when one of their monsters is sent from the field to the Graveyard. So if 2 are active, a player will take 1000 points of damage and if 4 are on the field (you have 3 active and your opponent has 1 active) a player will take 2000 points of damage.</li>
  <li>It is the owner of the Monster Card that takes the damage, so if you control your opponent’s monster through the effect of “Change of Heart” and Tribute it, your opponent takes the 500 points of damage.</li>

  <li>Q: If “Fiber Jar” is activated when there are “Scapegoat” Tokens on the field, are the tokens removed from the field?<br />
A: Tokens are treated as monsters and would be removed from the field by the effect of “Fiber Jar”. However, because they are Tokens, they are not sent to the Graveyard, but rather removed from play. bishop, 02/02/2004</li>

  <li>The opponent may activate a Trap Card that targets “Fiend Skull Dragon”, but its effect will be negated and the Trap Card destroyed.</li>
  <li>Cards such as “Torrential Tribute”, “Bottomless Trap Hole”, “Mirror Force”, and “Last Turn” will all apply their effects to “Fiend Skull Dragon” because these cards do not target.</li>

If the “Butterfly Dagger – Elma” specficially designates “Freed the Matchless General” it will be negated and destroyed by “Freed the Matchless General’s” effect. It would not return to the owner’s hand. “Blast with Chain” is considered a Trap Card when it chooses its target, so it can be equipped to “Freed the Matchless General.” He will not negate or destroy “Blast with Chain” when its resolves.

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you Set “Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast”, even without Tribute, you do not have to show it to your opponent.</li>
  <li>If you Set “Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast” without Tribute, it has ATK 1400 and DEF 1000 when flipped face-up.</li>

<h4 id="fusion-gate">FUSION GATE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fusion Monsters Special Summoned without “Polymerization” while “Fusion Gate” is on the field are still considered properly Summoned by a Fusion Summon.

  <li>“Fusion Recovery” targets 1 monster and 1 “Polymerization” in the Graveyard (so it will be negated by “Necrovalley” or “The End of Anubis”).</li>
  <li>If 1 of the targeted cards is no longer in the Graveyard when this effect resolve, you still resolve the rest of the effect as best you can.</li>

  <li>If you equip this card to “Gearfried the Iron Knight” it is not destroyed.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If I equip “Fusion Sword Murasame Blade” to “Spirit Reaper,” would “Spirit Reaper” be destroyed or would this be an illegal activation?<br />
A: You wouldn’t even be able to target him with it at all. “Spirit Reaper” is not a Warrior. It would be an illegal activation in this case. If “Spirit Reaper” were turned into a Warrior through “DNA Surgery”, equipping “Fusion Sword Masamune Blade” to “Spirit Reaper” would cause “Spirit Reaper” to destroy itself through its effect.

<h4 id="gatling-dragon">GATLING DRAGON</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must destroy as many monsters as possible based on the number of Heads you flip. If you flip 2 Heads, and the only monsters on the field are 1 of your opponent’s monsters and your “Gatling Dragon”, you must destroy both monsters. If there are only 2 monsters on the field and you flip 3 Heads, destroy both monsters.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “My Body as a Shield” as a chain to “Gatling Dragon” because it has not yet been decided if any monster(s) will be destroyed or not.</li>

  <li>You can only activate this card’s effect once per turn.</li>

<h4 id="gearfried-the-iron-knight">GEARFRIED THE IRON KNIGHT</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

  <li>“Call of the Haunted” does not equip itself to “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” “Gearfried the Iron Knight” can be successfully summoned by “Call of the Haunted.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If I Summon “Gearfried the Iron Knight” and my opponent activates “Trap Hole,” and I then chain “Blast with Chain,” what happens?<br />
A: “Blast with Chain” will equip to “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” “Gearfried the Iron Knight’s” effect would then destroy it. Next, “Trap Hole” resolves, destroying the Summoned “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” Now a new chain begins with “Blast with Chain’s” effect. You would select a card to destroy. The opponent could then respond with any appropriate card effects. Curtis Schultz, 03/31/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Can you use “Snatch Steal” on your opponent’s “Gearfried the Iron Knight” and before the equip is destroyed, use “Altar for Tribute”?<br />
A: “Gearfried the Iron Knight’s” effect is a Continuous Effect and it will not switch sides. “Snatch Steal” can be equipped to “Gearfried the Iron Knight,” but it will be destroyed immediately. Curtis Schultz, 04/15/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gearfried-the-swordmaster">GEARFRIED THE SWORDMASTER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you Tribute 1 “Gearfried the Iron Knight” to activate “Release Restraint”, then chain “Serial Spell”, you can Special Summon 2 “Gearfried the Swordmaster” cards from your Deck.</li>
  <li>The Equip Card must be successfully equipped to “Gearfried the Swordmaster” to activate his effect. For example, if “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to the activation of an Equip Card, it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard before resolving, so the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” does not activate.</li>
  <li>If your opponent equips “Snatch Steal” to your “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, the effect of “Snatch Steal” resolves first and control changes. Then the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates and your opponent gets to select which monster is destroyed.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates when 1 or more Equip Card(s) are equipped to him. So even if “Collected Power” equips several Equip Cards to him simultaneously, you can only destroy 1 monster with his effect.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to, starting a new chain after the current chain resolves. You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the activation of this effect.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” can activate even in the Damage Step. For example, if “Brain Jacker” is attacked by “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, and “Waboku” was activated earlier in the turn, “Brain Jacker” will equip to “Gearfried the Swordmaster” and the effect will activate. In this case, the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” will activate after the effect of “Brain Jacker” resolves, and the controller of “Brain Jacker” will select which monster to destroy.</li>
  <li>This is a targeting effect that targets 1 monster.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” will activate even if a Trap Card is equipped to him (such as “Metalmorph” or “Blast with Chain”).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="germ-infection">GERM INFECTION</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Germ Infection’s” ATK reducing effect continues even after the ATK of the equipped monster is reduced to 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Germ Infection’s” decrease continue to accumulate even after the ATK has reached 0?<br />
A: The decrease in ATK will continue to accumulate. So, if I have a “White Magicial Hat” equipped with “Germ Infection” for 4 Standby Phases, it would be receiving -1200 to its ATK. (I would treat its ATK as 0, since 1000 - 1200 = -200) If I were to equip an “Axe of Despair” to that same “White Magicial Hat,” its ATK would be 1000 + 1000 [Axe] - 1200 [Germ Infection] = 800 ATK. Curtis Schultz, 02/24/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="getsu-fuhma">GETSU FUHMA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Getsu Fuhma” is destroyed by damage calculation, its effect still activates as long as it battled a monster and damage calculation was performed.</li>
  <li>If an attack is negated by “Magic Cylinder”, etc., then “Getsu Fuhma”’s effect does not activate.</li>
  <li>If “Getsu Fuhma”’s ATK is large enough to destroy “Vampire Lord” by damage calculation, then “Getsu Fuhma”’s effect doesn’t activate and “Vampire Lord” won’t be Special Summoned, because it was destroyed by damage calculation and not by a card effect.</li>
  <li>If “Getsu Fuhma” is destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, “Getsu Fuhma”’s effect is not activated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ghost-knight-of-jackal">GHOST KNIGHT OF JACKAL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Ghost Knight of Jackal”’s effect activates when you send a monster to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If your “Ghost Knight of Jackal” attacks a face-down “Jowls of Dark Demise”, your opponent takes control of “Ghost Knight of Jackal” at the time that “Jowls of Dark Demise” is sent to the Graveyard, and “Ghost Knight of Jackal”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If “Ghost Knight of Jackal” is removed from the field or flipped face-down before the monster it destroyed is sent to the Graveyard, then “Ghost Knight of Jackal”’s effect is not applied.</li>
  <li>If “Final Attack Orders” is active, you can Special Summon a monster destroyed by “Ghost Knight of Jackal” in Defense Position, but it is changed to Attack Position immediately.</li>
  <li>If your “Ghost Knight of Jackal” destroys a monster you own that is on your opponent’s side of the field, the effect of “Ghost Knight of Jackal” is not applied because it only applies to “an opponent’s monster” that is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Ghost Knight of Jackal” attacks “Ghost Knight of Jackal”, neither effect is applied.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="giant-axe-mummy">GIANT AXE MUMMY</h4>

</ul>

<h4 id="giant-kozaky">GIANT KOZAKY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first part of “Giant Kozaky” is a Continuous Effect that does not start a chain. The second part is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the Trigger Effect (the damage) of “Giant Kozaky”.</li>
  <li>If “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed while face-down, then its effect that inflicts damage is not activated. If “Giant Kozaky” is face-up on the field and is targeted by “Tribute to the Doomed”, and you chain “Book of Moon” so that “Giant Kozaky” is face-down when destroyed by “Tribute to the Doomed”, there is no damage.</li>
  <li>Like “Atomic Firefly”, “Foxfire”, and “Poison Draw Frog”, if a face-down “Giant Kozaky” is attacked and destroyed, its effect is not applied. However, if a face-down “Giant Kozaky” is attacked, and is not destroyed by the attack, if “Kozaky” is not face-up on the field, then “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed by its own effect after damage calculation, and damage is inflicted by its effect.</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks a face-down “Giant Kozaky” while “Kozaky” is not on the field, “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed by the effect of “Drillroid” after being flipped face-up. The effect of “Giant Kozaky” is not applied and it does not inflict damage.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Giant Kozaky” that inflicts damage to the controller activates in the Graveyard or the “removed zone”, wherever “Giant Kozaky” goes to after being destroyed. “The End of Anubis” will negate the effect of “Giant Kozaky” if it was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, but “Banisher of the Light” will not (because “Giant Kozaky” does not have to be “destroyed and sent to the Graveyard”). Nor will “Skill Drain” negate the damage if “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Giant Kozaky” is face-up on the field with “Kozaky”, and “Kozaky” is equipped to “Relinquished”, “Giant Kozaky” is not destroyed because a card called “Kozaky” is on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Giant Kozaky” is equipped to “Relinquished” as an Equip Spell Card, “Giant Kozaky” will not be destroyed by its effect because it’s not a monster (even if “Kozaky” is not on the field).</li>
  <li>If “Giant Kozaky” is equipped to “Relinquished” and is destroyed by “Mystical Space Typhoon” or the effect of “Relinquished”, the effect of “Giant Kozaky” will inflict damage to the controller.</li>
</ul>

  <li>If your opponent controls your “Giant Rat” and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of “Giant Rat” NOT your opponent.</li>

  <li>“Disappear” can be chained to the effect of “Gilasaurus” to remove the monster chosen to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard from play.</li>
  <li>If “Necrovalley” is active on the field, “Gilasaurus” may still be used as a Special Summon. The opponent may not Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard from “Gilasaurus’” effect as a result of the effect of “Necrovalley.”</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, “Gilasaurus” may still be used as a Special Summon. The opponent may not Special Summon a monster from the Graveyard from “Gilasaurus’” effect as “Gilasaurus” effect is negated by “Skill Drain.”</li>

<h4 id="goblin-of-greed">GOBLIN OF GREED</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Goblin of Greed” prevents discarding as a cost, but not as part of an effect. So “Goblin of Greed” will stop “Kuriboh”, but not “Mirage of Nightmare” or “Graceful Charity”.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates an effect and discards as a cost, and you chain “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Goblin of Greed”, he doesn’t stop the effect because the cost was already paid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While “Goblin of Greed” is face-up and active on the field, effects that have an activation cost of discarding a card, like “Magic Jammer” or “Tribute to the Doomed” may not be activated. Effects that have an effect of discarding a card, or sending a card to the Graveyard, like “Graceful Charity” or “Mirage of Nightmare” may still be activated.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number of “Good Goblin Housekeeping” cards referred to by the effect is counted at resolution of this effect.

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Gorgon’s Eye” cannot negate the effect of “Sangan”, “Witch of the Black Forest”, or “Sinister Serpent” because they activate in the Graveyard. If a Defense Position “Slate Warrior” is attacked and destroyed, the effect of “Slate Warrior” that lowers ATK and DEF is applied because it activates in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>“Gorgon’s Eye”’s effect will include monsters in Defense Position that are Summoned after “Gorgon’s Eye” resolves.</li>
  <li>If a monster in Defense Position is changed to Attack Position, “Gorgon’s Eye” no longer affects the monster and the monster’s effect will be applied.</li>

  <li>Monsters like “D.D. Warrior Lady” attacked while in Defense Position have their effects negated (because they are used before the monster is sent to the Graveyard).</li>
  <li>While “Gorgon’s Eye” is active, if “Relinquished” equipped with a monster is in Defense Position, the effect of “Relinquished” is negated, it can no longer be equipped with a monster, and the Monster Card equipped to “Relinquished” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>

<h4 id="graceful-charity">GRACEFUL CHARITY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your opponent cannot activate “Appropriate” after you activate “Graceful Charity” since the last effect that resolves with “Graceful Charity” is discarding, not drawing, and your opponent misses the timing. But if your opponent already has an active “Appropriate” face-up on the field, he/she can draw 2 cards after you activate “Graceful Charity”.</li>
  <li>If “Solemn Wishes” is on the field when you activate “Graceful Charity”, you gain 500 Life Points after you finish both drawing and discarding. If “Solemn Wishes” and “Skull Invitation” are on the field, you finish both drawing and discarding for the effect of “Graceful Charity” then you gain 500 Life Points, then you lose 600 Life Points.</li>
  <li>If you have three pieces of Exodia in your hand, “Graceful Charity”, and no other cards, and then you activate “Graceful Charity” and draw the final 2 pieces of Exodia, you must discard 2 cards before a victory can be declared, but after you discard you will no longer have all 5 pieces of Exodia, and cannot declare a victory.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gradius-option">GRADIUS’ OPTION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ATK/DEF of “Gradius’ Option” is the same as the current ATK/DEF of the selected “Gradius”, not the original ATK/DEF. So if you equip “Axe of Despair” to “Gradius”, the ATK of “Gradius’ Option” will also increase by 1000 points.</li>
  <li>Equipping “Axe of Despair” to “Gradius’ Option” has no purpose. Activating “Reinforcements” targeting “Gradius’ Option” serves no purpose. “Luminous Spark” on the field will not change the ATK/DEF of “Gradius’ Option”. It always has the same ATK/DEF of the selected “Gradius”.</li>
  <li>If the selected “Gradius” is flipped face-down, “Gradius’ Option” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If the selected “Gradius” is temporarily removed from play by the effect of “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”, “Gradius’ Option” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Gradius’ Option” is temporarily removed from play by the effect of “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”, when it returns to the field you must select a new “Gradius”. If there is no “Gradius” on the field, it is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you pick up “Gradius’ Option” by the effect of “Cyber Jar” you cannot Special Summon it, even if “Gradius” is also in the 5 cards you picked up. It is placed in your hand instead.</li>
  <li>If you pick up “Gradius’ Option” by the effect of “Morphing Jar #2” you cannot Special Summon it, and it is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Gradius’s Option” copies the ATK/DEF value of the “Gradius” chosen when “Gradius’s Option” is summoned at all times.</li>
  <li>If “Gradius’s Option” would be affected by an effect that alters “Gradius’s Option’s” ATK or DEF value, “Gradius’s Option’s” ATK or DEF value will not change.</li>
  <li>“Gradius’s Option” may only be initially Special Summoned from the hand.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, “Gradius’s Option’s” ATK and DEF will be 0.</li>
  <li>“Gradius’s Option” may not be searched by the effect of “Witch of the Black Forest” as “Gradius’s Option” does not have a specific DEF value.</li>

<h4 id="granadora">GRANADORA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As with most targeting effects that have specific conditions, if the targeted card is flipped face-up in a chain (for example, if it is a monster and “Ceasefire” is activated, or if it is a Trap Card and is chained to the effect of “Granmarg the Rock Monarch”), then the effect of “Granmarg the Rock Monarch” disappears.</li>

<h4 id="grave-ohja">GRAVE OHJA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<p>If you control “Grave Ohja” and you Flip Summon a Flip Effect Monster, the two effects go on a chain. You can choose which effect is chain link 1.</p>

<p>If you control multiple copies of “Grave Ohja” and Flip Summon a monster, the effects go on a chain and you can choose the order of the chain links.</p>

<p>The second effect of “Grave Ohja” is a Trigger Effect that activates when a monster is Flip Summoned. It can be chained to.</p>

<p>If “Grave Ohja” is attacked, and you activate “Book of Moon” to flip another monster on your side of the field face-down, “Grave Ohja” has already been selected as the attack target so the attack proceeds as normal.</p>

<h4 id="grave-protector">GRAVE PROTECTOR</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Grave Protector”’s effect is not applied to itself when it is destroyed as a result of battle.</li>
  <li>Effects like “Mystic Tomato”, etc., are not activated while “Grave Protector” is face-up on the field.</li>
  <li>A monster destroyed by “Dark Magician of Chaos” or “Lesser Fiend” is returned to the Deck instead of being removed from play.</li>
  <li>A monster that battles with “D.D. Warrior Lady” is still removed from play even if “Grave Protector” is on the field (if “D.D. Warrior Lady”’s effect is activated).</li>
  <li>If “Banisher of the Light” and “Grave Protector” are both active, destroyed monsters are removed from play.</li>
  <li>When there is a face-up “Grave Protector” on the field and a face-down “Desertapir” is attacked, and “Desertapir’s” Flip Effect flips “Grave Protector” face-down, the Desertapir is sent to the Graveyard at the end of the Damage Step instead of to the Deck.</li>
  <li>If “Grave Protector” is on the field, the effect of “Slate Warrior” that reduces the ATK and DEF of the monster that destroys “Slate Warrior” is still applied, even though “Slate Warrior” is shuffled back into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard. The timing of “Slate Warrior’s” effect is still at the end of the Damage Step (when monsters are normally sent to the Graveyard after battle).</li>
  <li>If “Grave Protector” is on the field when a monster like “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” or “Great Dezard” (with an effect based on when they destroy a monster in battle) battles and destroys a monster, then the “Great Dezard”, etc., still gets the reward for destroying the monster even though the destroyed monster was shuffled into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Grave Protector” is on the field, a monster destroyed by “Sword Hunter” is shuffled into the Deck instead of becoming an Equip Spell Card.</li>

<h4 id="gravekeepers-assailant">GRAVEKEEPER’S ASSAILANT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Gravekeeper’s Assailant” changes Attack Position to Defense Position or vice-versa. It cannot flip a monster face-down because that is not a change of battle position.</li>
  <li>You make the change of battle position due to “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” at the beginning of the attack, so you can change the battle position even if the attack is then negated by “Magic Cylinder”, etc.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” and “Necrovalley” are both in play, “Necrovalley” is still on the field so you can still activate the effect of “Gravekeeper’s Assailant”.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” targets 1 monster.</li>
  <li>If “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” attacks, and activates its effect to change the battle position of the opponent’s “Spirit Reaper”, then “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by its own effect. Then a replay occurs because the potential attack targets on the opponent’s side of the field were changed. In this case, “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” can attack again, and can activate its effect again.</li>
  <li>If “Necrovalley” is on the field, an attack is declared with “Gravekeeper’s Assailant”, and the effect of “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” is activated, and “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to the effect to destroy “Necrovalley”, the effect of “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” is still applied because “Necrovalley” only had to be on the field to activate the effect.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use the effect of “Gravekeeper’s Chief” to Special Summon the same monster you Tributed to Summon “Gravekeeper’s Chief”.</li>

  <li>If you have “Gravekeeper’s Chief” and “Necrovalley” on the field, you can use “Monster Reborn”, “Premature Burial”, “Call of the Haunted”, etc. to revive monsters from your Graveyard. Also, if you have “Gravekeeper’s Chief” on the field, your opponent can use “Monster Reborn” on monsters in your Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “The Shallow Grave” while “Necrovalley” is active, even if you control “Gravekeeper’s Chief”, because your opponent cannot Special Summon a monster from his Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Necrovalley” is on the field, and both players control a “Gravekeeper’s Chief”, then the Flip Effect of “Fiber Jar” can resolve normally, but if neither, or only 1, player has “Gravekeeper’s Chief”, then the Flip Effect of “Fiber Jar” disappears.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The damage that is inflicted to your opponent’s Life Points as a result of battle with “Gravekeeper’s Vassal” attack is treated as effect damage instead, not Battle Damage. So your opponent cannot use “Kuriboh” or “Waboku” to prevent the damage, for example.</li>
  <li>A monster destroyed by “Gravekeeper’s Vassal” in battle is still treated as “destroyed as a result of battle” (for “Mystic Tomato”, “Nimble Momonga”, etc.).</li>
  <li>If you equip “Fairy Meteor Crush” to “Gravekeeper’s Vassal”, and attack a Defense Position monster and inflict Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points, the damage is treated as effect damage due to “Gravekeeper’s Vassal”’s effect.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against damage inflicted by “Gravekeeper’s Vassal” because its effect is a Continuous Effect and you cannot activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against Continuous Effects.</li>

  <li>You cannot activate “Gravekeeper’s Watcher” against your opponent’s “Delinquent Duo” because it makes YOU discard, not your opponent.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Gravekeeper’s Watcher” against the activation of your opponent’s “Mirage of Nightmare” because it is possible that your opponent will not have to discard (for example, by having more than 4 cards in his hand).</li>
  <li>When “Morphing Jar” is Flip Summoned, you may chain the effect of “Gravekeeper’s Watcher”, negating the Flip Effect of “Morphing Jar” and destroying it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Which card effects can the effect of “Gravekeeper’s Watcher” be used against? Can it be used against “Mirage of Nightmare?”<br />
A: It works against card effects that would require the opponent to discard cards from their own hand, but not if the discard was a cost. “Graceful Charity” and “Card Destruction” come to mind. There really aren’t many options. You cannot use “Gravekeeper’s Watcher” against “Mirage of Nightmare.” Curtis Schultz, 12/07/2003</li>

  <li>If you have your opponent’s “Pot of Greed” in your hand because of “Exchange” or “Graverobber”, you CAN send your opponent’s “Pot of Greed” to the Graveyard to activate your “Avatar of the Pot”’s effect. But if you did this with “Graverobber”, you take 2000 points of damage to do so</li>
  <li>“Barrel Behind the Door” cannot be activated against cards that do not inflict damage when the card resolves, such as “Graverobber”, which inflicts damage later.</li>
  <li>“Des Wombat” will protect you against the effect damage of “Graverobber”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Graverobber” is chained to the effect of a card that would remove a Spell Card from the game by any means than as a cost, “Graverobber” may target that Spell Card to remove it from the Graveyard before that effect resolves.</li>

<h4 id="greed">GREED</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Greed” only applies to cards drawn while “Greed” was active. If “Jar of Greed” is chained to “Greed”’s activation, “Jar of Greed” (Step 2) resolves and you draw 1 card for “Jar of Greed” before “Greed”’s effect (Step 1) was active, so no damage is inflicted during the End Phase. But if you chain “Greed” (Step 2) to “Pot of Greed” (Step 1), then “Greed” is active before “Pot of Greed” resolves, so the activator of “Pot of Greed” takes 1000 damage from “Greed”.</li>

  <li>Q: What happens if my opponent has 2 “Guardian Kay’est” on the field? (Can I attack directly still even though they have more than one?).<br />
A: Having 2 “Guardian Kay’est” is no different from just 1. Whether your opponent has 1, 2, or 3 of them on the field, you are still able to attack directly. This is assuming that they have no other monsters on the field, of course. Steve Okegawa, 02/22/04</li>

A: “Guardian Kay’est” would not be a valid target for “Staunch Defender” because your opponent cannot attack “Guardian Kay’est.” This is due to the effect of “Guardian Kay’est.” Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</li>

<h4 id="guardian-sphinx">GUARDIAN SPHINX</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Guardian Sphinx” is turned face down, all Equip Spell Cards equipped to “Guardian Sphinx” are sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Guardian Sphinx” is in face-up Defense Position and uses its effect to turn it to face-down Defense Position, “Guardian Sphinx” may be Flip Summoned if it has not had another position change, or was summoned, this turn.</li>
  <li>If a “Guardian Sphinx” Special Summoned by the effect of “Call of the Haunted” successfully uses its effect to turn itself face down, “Call of the Haunted” remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If “Guardian Sphinx” is Flip Summoned and “Torrential Tribute” is chained to the effect, “Torrential Tribute” will resolve first destroying all monsters on the field.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="guardian-tryce">GUARDIAN TRYCE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you Special Summon “Guardian Tryce”, you don’t get to activate his effect when he’s destroyed, even if you Tribute Summoned him previously and are using “Monster Reborn” on him later.</li>
  <li>You must Special Summon the exact same card that was Tributed for “Guardian Tryce” when using his effect; you cannot Special Summon a card of the same name.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Guardian Tryce”’s effect to Special Summon a “Special Summon-only” monster that had not been properly Summoned, such as a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned with “Magical Scientist” and then Tributed for “Guardian Tryce”.</li>
  <li>You cannot Special Summon “Dark Ruler Ha Des” with “Guardian Tryce”’s effect.</li>
  <li>You can Special Summon a monster in your opponent’s Graveyard if it was used to Tribute Summon “Guardian Tryce”.</li>
  <li>If “Guardian Tryce” is an Equip Spell Card equipped to “Relinquished” or “Sword Hunter”, and “Guardian Tryce” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, his effect activates.</li>
  <li>If “Guardian Tryce” is Set and is destroyed, his effect activates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the monster Tributed to Tribute Summon “Guardian Tryce” is not in the Graveyard when “Guardian Tryce” is destroyed, that monster will not be Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>The owner of “Guardian Tryce” will receive “Guardian Tryce’s” Special Summoning effect, regardless of who controlled “Guardian Tryce” when it was destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="guardians">GUARDIANS</h4>

<ul>
  <li>“Guardian Baou”, “Guardian Ceal”, “Guardian Elma”, “Guardian Grarl”, “Guardian Kay’est”, and “Guardian Tryce” all share some basic rules. Using “Guardian Elma” as an example:</li>
  <li>You can Set “Guardian Elma” face-down without “Butterfly Dagger - Elma”, but you cannot Special Summon her face-down with “The Shallow Grave”, etc., unless you have “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” on your side of the field.</li>
  <li>If your Set “Guardian Elma” is flipped face-up with “Swords of Revealing Light”, or by an attack, without “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” on your side of the field, she remains on the field because she was not Summoned.</li>
  <li>“Guardian Elma” is a normally Summoned monster, not a Special Summon-only monster. So if Normal Summoned she counts as your 1 Summon for the turn.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Monster Reborn” on “Guardian Elma” if you do not have “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” on your side of the field.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Monster Reborn” and target “Guardian Elma” while you have “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” on the field, and your opponent chains “Mystical Space Typhoon” to destroy “Butterfly Dagger - Elma”, so that it is no longer on the field when “Monster Reborn” resolves, you cannot Special Summon “Guardian Elma” and “Monster Reborn”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>You can Normal Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon “Guardian Elma” even if your “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” has its effect negated by “Imperial Order”.</li>
  <li>If “Cyber Jar” resolves and you pick up “Guardian Elma” without “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” on your side of the field, “Guardian Elma” is added to your hand.</li>

<h4 id="gyroid">GYROID</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot choose when to apply “Gyroid’s” effect. If “Gyroid” would be destroyed as a result of battle, its effect is applied (once per turn) whether you want it to be destroyed or not.</li>
  <li>If “Gyroid” is destroyed, and is then Special Summoned again that same turn, the effect is reset and its effect will be applied again if appropriate. If “Gyroid” is attacked once, is not destroyed because of its effect, then gets flipped face-down, its effect is reset and will be applied again if attacked that turn.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gyroid” is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to (including “Divine Wrath”).</li>
  <li>If “Gyroid” is attacked for the first time in a turn by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, “Gyroid”’s effect is not negated because it will not be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Gyroid” is equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform”, the effect of “Gyroid” will prevent both from being destroyed in battle. If attacked again the same turn and “Gyroid” would be destroyed, “Heavy Mech Support Platform” will be destroyed instead. A third attack will then destroy “Gyroid” normally.</li>
  <li>If “Gyroid” is attacked during a Special Battle Phase created by the effect of “Last Turn”, and is then attacked again during the regular Battle Phase, it will be destroyed because its effect was already applied once that turn (during the Special Battle Phase).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hallowed-life-barrier">HALLOWED LIFE BARRIER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Hallowed Life Barrier” protects your Life Points from Battle Damage and Effect Damage. It doesn’t protect your monsters from being destroyed as a result of battle.</li>

<h4 id="hammer-shot">HAMMER SHOT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="hand-of-nephthys">HAND OF NEPHTHYS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Tribute 2 monsters on your side of the field, including this card” means that you Tribute “Hand of Nephthys” plus 1 additional monster.</li>
  <li>Ignition Effects on monsters cannot be activated while the Effect Monster is face-down. So this face-down monster cannot be Tributed for its own effect.</li>
  <li>You can chain to the activation of this monster’s effect.</li>
  <li>Tributing monsters is a cost of this card’s effect.</li>
  <li>You can Tribute a Monster Token as part of this card’s cost.</li>
  <li>You can chain to the activation of “Hand of Nephthys’” effect with the effect of “Royal Oppression” to negate the Special Summon of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="harpie-lady-1">HARPIE LADY 1</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name of “Harpie Lady 1”, “Harpie Lady 2”, and “Harpie Lady 3” is treated as “Harpie Lady” for all purposes, including Deck construction. So you can have 2 copies of “Harpie Lady 1” in your Deck and 1 copy of “Harpie Lady 2”, but not 2 copies of each because you would have 4 cards in your Deck treated as “Harpie Lady”. This restriction also applies to your Side Deck, so if you have 3 monsters treated as “Harpie Lady” in your Deck, you cannot have any in your Side Deck.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Harpie Lady 1” will increase the ATK of your opponent’s WIND monsters too.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="harpie-lady-3">HARPIE LADY 3</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the effect of “Harpie Lady 3” count only your opponent’s turns. If your opponent’s monster attacks “Harpie Lady 3”, then count that turn as the first of the two turns. (So the monster could not attack again that turn, even if it had the ability to attack more than once, and it could not attack on your opponent’s next turn either.) If “Harpie Lady 3” attacks your opponent’s monster, then that monster cannot attack for your opponent’s next 2 turns.</li>
  <li>If “Element Magician” attacks and destroys “Harpie Lady 3” while there is another WIND monster on the field, “Element Magician” cannot attack again that turn.</li>
  <li>If you control “Harpie Lady 3” and “Gemini Elf” and your opponent activates “Change of Heart” to gain control of “Gemini Elf”, then attacks your “Harpie Lady 3”, your “Gemini Elf” cannot attack for 2 of your opponent’s turns, even after it returns to your side of the field.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="harpies-hunting-ground">HARPIES’ HUNTING GROUND</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you control “Harpies’ Hunting Ground” on your side of the field, because it is a Field Spell Card, its effects apply to both players. When either player Normal Summons or Special Summons a “Harpie Lady” or “Harpie Lady Sisters” to the field, the controller of that newly-Summoned monster is the one who selects 1 Spell or Trap Card and destroys it.</li>
  <li>You can chain to the effect of “Harpies’ Hunting Ground” that destroys 1 Spell or Trap Card.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Harpies’ Hunting Ground” that increases ATK and DEF is applied to all face-up Winged Beast-Type monsters on the field, including your opponent’s, because it is a Field Spell Card.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="harpies-pet-dragon">HARPIE’S PET DRAGON</h4>

</ul>

<h4 id="heart-of-clear-water">HEART OF CLEAR WATER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may equip this card to a monster with ATK 1300 or greater, but it will be immediately destroyed.</li>
  <li>If a monster equipped with this card has its ATK increased over 1299, by the effect of “Rush Recklessly”, etc., this card is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If your “Relinquished” or “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” is equipped with “Heart of Clear Water” and you its effect to equip it with a Monster Card whose ATK is 1300 or higher, “Heart of Clear Water” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>Your monster equipped with “Heart of Clear Water” is not destroyed in battle, but you still take any Battle Damage that would be inflicted to your Life Points by the attack.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon a monster with “Premature Burial” or “Call of the Haunted” and then equip that monster with “Heart of Clear Water”, the monster will not be destroyed if “Premature Burial” or “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>A monster equipped with this card can still be destroyed by effects that do not target, such as the effects of “Fissure”, “Dark Hole”, “Smashing Ground”, or “Torrential Tribute”.</li>
  <li>A monster equipped with this card cannot be destroyed by a card that targets, but it may still be declared a target. So the opponent may activate “Nightmare Wheel” or “Snatch Steal” targeting your monster equipped with “Heart of Clear Water”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If a monster is equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” lower its ATK so it can be equipped with “Heart of Clear Water,” would the “Heart of Clear Water” remain equipped to the monster if the “Ring of Magnetism” was destroyed?<br />
A: If the monster equipped with “Heart of Clear Water” has their attack rise above 1300 at any time, the “Heart of Clear Water” is immediately destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 12/08/2003</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="heart-of-the-underdog">HEART OF THE UNDERDOG</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing the Timing: Suppose you have 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” on the field, and draw a Normal Monster Card during your Draw Phase. All 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” immediately activate their effects, and because they activate simultaneously, they form a chain with Chain Links 1, 2, and 3. If you draw a Normal Monster card for Chain Link 3 or Chain Link 2, your copies of “Heart of the Underdog” do not activate again. This is because they are “when… you can” optional Trigger Effects, and you “miss the timing” because you drew the Normal Monster Card during a chain and not as Chain Link 1. However, if you draw a Normal Monster Card for Chain Link 1, all 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” will activate their effects again.</li>
  <li>“Heart of the Underdog” doesn’t only activate if you draw a Normal Monster Card for your standard draw. It will also activate its effect if you draw a Normal Monster Card with a card effect such as “Reload”, “Jar of Greed”, or “Heart of the Underdog”.</li>
  <li>When you draw a Normal Monster Card, if you want to activate the effect of “Heart of the Underdog” you have to show it to your opponent immediately. You can’t do anything else in between.</li>
  <li>A Normal Monster Card means a yellow card with no effect. A Ritual Monster with no effect is not a Normal Monster Card. A card like “Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon” is not a Normal Monster Card.</li>
  <li>When you show a Normal Monster Card to your opponent to activate “Heart of the Underdog”, your opponent can chain “Drop Off”. You will have to discard that Normal Monster Card, but “Heart of the Underdog” still resolves its effect.</li>
  <li>If you draw multiple cards at the same time during your Draw Phase, such as with “Reload”, only 1 of the cards needs to be a Normal Monster to trigger “Heart of the Underdog”, since they are all drawn at the same time. If you activate “Reload” in your Draw Phase and draw 5 Normal Monster Cards, your “Heart of the Underdog” only activates 1 time because it says “card(s)”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="heavy-mech-support-platform">HEAVY MECH SUPPORT PLATFORM</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note that “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is different from other Union Monsters in that its last sentence is applied if the monster it is equipped to is destroyed (period), not just when the monster is destroyed as a result of battle. This extra effect does not apply to previous Union Monsters.</li>
  <li>If a monster equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is targeted by “Ring of Destruction”, then “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is destroyed instead of the equipped monster, and the damage inflicted to both players by “Ring of Destruction” is 0 (because the monster targeted by “Ring of Destruction” was not destroyed by it).</li>
  <li>If you have a monster, “X-Head Cannon” for example, equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform”, and you activate “Limiter Removal”, the ATK will becomes (1800 + 500) x 2 = 4600. Also, the “Heavy Mech Support Platform” will be destroyed instead of the “X-Head Cannon” during the End Phase (by the effect of “Limiter Removal”).</li>
  <li>If “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is equipped to “Big Core” or “Reflect Bounder” and they would be destroyed by their effect, “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is destroyed instead.</li>
  <li>If “Reflect Bounder” equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, during damage calculation “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is destroyed instead of “Reflect Bounder”. Then, after damage calculation, “Reflect Bounder” will destroy itself by its own effect. Its effect is not negated, because it was not destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="helpoemer">HELPOEMER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you have multiple “Helpoemer” cards in your Graveyard, each with an activated effect, the effects are cumulative.</li>
  <li>If your opponent chooses not to conduct a Battle Phase, there is no timing for the end of the Battle Phase, so the effect of “Helpoemer” is not activated. The same is true if the Battle Phase is skipped due to a card effect.</li>
  <li>“Helpoemer” cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard even if it was not destroyed as a result of battle (the final sentence on “Helpoemer” is a condition, not an effect, and is not subject to the first sentence on “Helpoemer”).</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Helpoemer” may not be Special Summoned from the Graveyard for any reason. “Helpoemer’s” ‘discard 1 card’ effect only activates if it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hidden-book-of-spell">HIDDEN BOOK OF SPELL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have zero or 1 Spell Cards in your Graveyard, you cannot activate “Hidden Book of Spell”.</li>
  <li>When you activate “Hidden Book of Spell” and your opponent chains “Disappear” or “Graverobber”, and 1 of the targeted Spell Cards is removed from play, the remaining Spell Card goes back to the Deck and the Deck is shuffled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Is “Hidden Book of Spell” a card that must select 2 cards (in other words, can I activate this trap when only 1 Spell card exists in my graveyard?) Does this card actually mean “up to 2” cards?<br />
A: Exactly 2 are declared at the time of activation. No more and no less can be chosen. If your opponent activates “Disappear” and chooses 1 of the two spells you had selected, the remaining spell would still be placed into the Deck per the card’s effect. Curtis Schultz, 12/10/2003</li>

  <li>The effect of “Hieroglyph Lithograph” cannot be negated by “Imperial Order” after “Hieroglyph Lithograph” has resolved. You can, of course, chain “Imperial Order” to the activation of “Hieroglyph Lithograph” to negate the effect.</li>
  <li>When “Infinite Cards” and “Hieroglyph Lithograph” are both in effect, there is no limit to the number of cards for your hand.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hiita-the-fire-charmer">HIITA THE FIRE CHARMER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your opponent chains “Enemy Controller” to the activation of the Flip Effect of a “Charmer”, and takes control of the “Charmer”, the Flip Effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you take control of the opponent’s monster with a “Charmer” and the opponent takes control back with “Change of Heart”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Change of Heart” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).</li>
  <li>If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.</li>
  <li>If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.</li>
  <li>If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.</li>
  <li>If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.</li>

<h4 id="hino-kagu-tsuchi">HINO-KAGU-TSUCHI</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When your “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi” inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, he / she discards his / her hand before drawing in their next Draw Phase. If their next Draw Phase is skipped, they discard at the start of the Standby Phase. If the Draw Phase and Standby Phase are skipped, they discard at the start of Main Phase 1.</li>
  <li>The opponent cannot activate any effects at the start of their turn before they discard their hand for the effect of “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are no chainable events before you Draw a card (and “Hino Kagu-Tsuchi” does not need to be errata’d). You cannot activate anything prior to Drawing a card. “Hino Kagu-Tsuchi” is not activating prior to the Draw. It is resolving. In any case, the effect of “Hino Kagu-Tsuchi” will resolve but, quite frankly, doesn’t even care if it is at the beginning of your Draw Phase. If your Draw Phase is skipped it will happen at the beginning of your Standby Phase. If your Draw Phase and your Standby Phase are skipped, it will happen at the beginning of your Main Phase 1. And so on and so forth.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active when “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi” inflicts Battle Damage, “HinoKagu-Tsuchi’s” discarding effect will not activate. If “Skill Drain” is activated after “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi” inflicts Battle Damage, “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi’s” discarding effect will still activate.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a “Sangan” or a “Witch of the Black Forest” equipped with “Horn of Light” is Tributed and you activate the effect of “Horn of Light”, “Horn of Light” goes on top of your Deck and then “Sangan” or “Witch of the Black Forest” is resolved. If “Sangan” is destroyed (not Tributed) the effects of “Sangan” and “Horn of Light” are simultaneous and form a chain.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="horus-servant">HORUS’ SERVANT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Horus’ Servant” has an effect just like “Lord of D.”, but only applicable to “Horus the Black Flame Dragon”. “Horus’ Servant” will not negate a card effect. All it does is prevent “Horus the Black Flame Dragon” from being selected as a target. If your opponent selects “Horus the Black Flame Dragon” as a target (with “Ring of Destruction”, for example), and you chain “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Horus’ Servant”, then “Horus the Black Flame Dragon” will still be destroyed by “Ring of Destruction” because “Horus’ Servant” is being Special Summoned AFTER “Horus the Black Flame Dragon” was selected. The fact that “Ring of Destruction” has not yet resolved does not matter; “Horus the Black Flame Dragon” was selected at activation of “Ring of Destruction”, and “Horus’ Servant” is Special Summoned too late to prevent this.</li>
  <li>Your opponent cannot activate a Spell Card, Trap Card, or Monster Effect that would select “Horus the Black Flame Dragon” as a target while “Horus’ Servant” is in play. “Horus’ Servant” does not cause the effect to be negated; he prevents the activation of the effect in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="horus-the-black-flame-dragon-lv4">HORUS THE BLACK FLAME DRAGON LV4</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “you” in “on your side of the field” is the current controller’s field, so as long as “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4” is face-up, it is always “face-up on your side of the field”.</li>
  <li>If “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4” destroys a monster, you can activate its effect during the End Phase, even if the destroyed monster was your monster that was controlled by your opponent.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” in your hand or Deck, you can still send “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4” to the Graveyard to activate its effect. But if you don’t have “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” then your opponent can check your Deck to confirm.</li>
  <li>If “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4” destroys a monster as a result of battle, and is removed from play by “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, and returns to play during the End Phase, you can still activate its effect.</li>
  <li>“If Banisher of the Light” is in play, you cannot send “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4” to the Graveyard, so you cannot activate its effect.</li>
  <li>You don’t have to send “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4” to the Graveyard if you don’t want to, even if it destroyed a monster as a result of battle. But if you activate its effect by sending it to the Graveyard, you must Special Summon “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” if possible.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4” during your opponent’s End Phase if appropriate.</li>
  <li>If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if “Armed Dragon LV5” destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="horus-the-black-flame-dragon-lv6">HORUS THE BLACK FLAME DRAGON LV6</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “you” in “on your side of the field” is the current controller’s field, so as long as “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” is face-up, it is always “face-up on your side of the field”.</li>
  <li>You cannot Tribute “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” for “Ectoplasmer”’s effect because it is not a cost, it is a Tribute when you resolve “Ectoplasmer”’s effect, and “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6” is not affected by Spell Cards’ effects.</li>
  <li>If “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6” is equipped with “Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite”, and would be destroyed as a result of battle, “Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite” is destroyed instead (this is not negated by “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6”’s effect).</li>
  <li>If “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” is the only monster on the field, you can activate a Spell Card that targets, but its effect will be negated because “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” would be the only valid target and it is unaffected by Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Level Up!” and send “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6” to the Graveyard to Special Summon “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 8” because sending 1 monster to the Graveyard is a cost for “Level Up!” and if a card is unaffected by Spell Cards, that only refers to effects, not to costs.</li>
  <li>If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if “Armed Dragon LV5” destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.</li>

<h4 id="horus-the-black-flame-dragon-lv8">HORUS THE BLACK FLAME DRAGON LV8</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note that “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8” has the word “except” in its Summoning conditions, which means that even if Special Summoned properly, you cannot revive it with “Monster Reborn” afterwards if it is destroyed.</li>
  <li>The “you” in “on your side of the field” is the current controller’s field, so as long as “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 8” is face-up, it is always “face-up on your side of the field”.</li>
  <li>The ability of “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8” to negate Spell Cards is a multi-trigger effect that must be chained to the activation of the Spell Card. You can activate this effect multiple times in the same chain to negate the activation and effect of several Spell Cards that are activated in the same chain.</li>
  <li>You can chain the effect of “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8” to the activation of a Continuous Spell Card, Field Spell Card, or Equip Spell Card and negate it. However, if the Continuous, Field, or Equip Spell Card is already active, you cannot later decide to try and negate its effect with “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8”. You can only negate it when it is originally activated.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8” during the Damage Step.</li>

<h4 id="huge-revolution">HUGE REVOLUTION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When your opponent chains “Book of Moon” to your “Huge Revolution” and flips 1 of the 3 monsters face-down, “Huge Revolution” has already been activated correctly so the effect of “Huge Revolution” resolves.</li>
  <li>When your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” to your “Huge Revolution” and destroys 1 of the 3 monsters, “Huge Revolution” has already been activated correctly so the effect of “Huge Revolution” resolves.</li>

<h4 id="human-wave-tactics">HUMAN-WAVE TACTICS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Human-Wave Tactics” includes Tokens.</li>
  <li>If you have 2 “Human-Wave Tactics” then both effects are applied, so if 1 Level 2 or lower Normal Monster is destroyed in battle, then you Special Summon 2 monsters.</li>
  <li>If your monster is destroyed as a result of battle while on your opponent’s side of the field, you can’t get the effect of “Human-Wave Tactics” for that monster.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have enough vacant Monster Card Zones to Special Summon as many monsters as you need to for “Human-Wave Tactics”, Special Summon as many as you can, and the rest are destroyed. This is also true for multiple “Human-Wave Tactics”, so if you have 2 “Human Wave Tactics”, and each wants to Summon 2 monsters, and you only have 3 Zones, Special Summon 3 monsters and destroy 1 monster.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hyena">HYENA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>If “Imperial Order” is active and “Swords of Revealing Light” is on the field, “Swords of Revealing Light” will remain on the field for its normal duration. As long as “Imperial Order” is active, “Swords of Revealing Light” will not prevent the opponent from attacking.</li>
  <li>“Imperial Order” has no effect on the equipped monster of “Thousand Eyes Restrict.” “Thousand Eyes Restrict” will maintain the ATK and DEF value of the equipped monster.</li>
  <li>If a Union monster is equipped to a monster and “Imperial Order” is active, the effect of the Union monster is negated. If a Union monster is equipped to a monster and “Imperial Order” is active, the Union monster may not use its effect to return to the monster field.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: In the event that the player has the exact amount of LP to pay for “Imperial Order,” they would be destroyed because paying for them would reduce the player’s LP to zero?<br />
A: This card does not have mandatory payments. The player controlling it can opt not to pay and the card would then be destroyed. They cannot choose to pay if it would make their Life Points become 0. Curtis Schultz, 12/23/2003</li>
  <li>Q: If one opponent activates “Limiter Removal” and the other chains with “Imperial Order,” would the monsters not get the power up but still die.<br />
A: “Imperial Order” negates all of “Limiter Removal’s” effects. But if you use “Limiter Removal,” attack, and then activate “Imperial Order” during Main Phase 2, the machines are STILL destroyed. bishop, 12/05/2003</li>
  <li>Q: Why is a card’s turn count ability (“Swords of Revealing Light”, “Final Countdown”, etc.) not considered part of its effect when being negated with “Imperial Order”?<br />
A: “Imperial Order”’s presence on the field does not mean that the count of anything (phase, turn, etc) stops. bishop, 01/16/2004</li>
  <li>Q: My opponent plays “Prohibition” and declares “Mystical Space Typhoon” and I chain “Imperial Order” to the activation; since “Imperial Order” just negates (not destroys) the “Prohibition” remains on the field and once “Imperial Order” leaves the field, it’s effect kicks in and “Mystical Space Typhoon” cannot be played. Is this true?<br />
A: That is correct. When “Imperial Order” is negated or destroyed, the effect of “Prohibition” will resume being in effect and would then prohibit the declared card, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in this case. Curtis Schultz, 04/20/2004</li>

  <li>If you control “Red-Eyes B. Dragon” and activate “Inferno Fire Blast” to inflict damage, and then after that resolves you activate “Non-Spellcasting Area”, “Red-Eyes B. Dragon” still cannot attack because “Non-Spellcasting Area” will not negate the condition.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” is chained to “Inferno Fire Blast”, the effect of “Inferno Fire Blast” is negated but “Red-Eyes B. Dragon” cannot attack. However, if “Magic Jammer” negates the activation of “Inferno Fire Blast”, your “Red-Eyes B. Dragon” can attack.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Inferno Fire Blast” while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, the effect of “Inferno Fire Blast” disappears.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does the effect of “Dark Balter the Terrible” or “Dark Ruler Ha Des” negate the effect of “Injection Fairy Lily?”<br />
A: No. “Injection Fairy Lily’s” effect activates during the damage calculation. “Dark Balter the Terrible” would not be able to negate this, nor could “Dark Ruler Ha Des.” Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Would “Injection Fairy Lily” equipped with “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” result in “Injection Fairy Lily” attacking for 3000 or would the decrease take place further after her effect?<br />
A: The decrease will be taken after the 3000 increase. So an “Injection Fairy Lily” equipped with “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” and activates its effect will have 2400 ATK during the damage calculation. Curtis Schultz, 01/8/2004</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your opponent can still Flip Summon a monster.</li>
  <li>If there are already more monsters on your opponent’s side of the field when you activate “Kaiser Colosseum”, nothing happens to your opponent’s monsters but your opponent cannot Summon any more. Also, if the number of monsters controlled by “Kaiser Colosseum”’s controller is reduced, the opponent does not have to remove any of his monsters.</li>
  <li>Your opponent cannot use “Monster Reborn”, “Scapegoat”, etc. while “Kaiser Colosseum” prevents him from placing new monsters. However, your opponent CAN use “Change of Heart”, “Snatch Steal”, etc.</li>
  <li>If all monsters of “Kaiser Colosseum”’s controller are destroyed, “Kaiser Colosseum”’s effect no longer functions until that player has at least 1 monster again (when the effect re-activates).</li>
  <li>If the player who controls “Kaiser Colosseum” has his only monster taken by the opponent with “Change of Heart”, then the opponent can place more monsters because “Kaiser Colosseum”’s effect is no longer active until the player has at least 1 monster again.</li>
  <li>When “Kaiser Colosseum” is active, and “Cyber Jar” is activated, if your opponent would control more monsters than you, your opponent has to destroy monsters equal to the difference; the excess monsters are never actually Summoned and instead are sent from the Deck to the Graveyard (so “Witch of the Black Forest” does not get its effect, etc.). So the monsters are destroyed after they are picked up, but before any monsters are Special Summoned for the effect of “Cyber Jar”.</li>

</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Would “Messenger of Peace” effectively stop “Karate Man” from using his effect?<br />
A: “Karate Man’s” effect is Spell Speed 1, and it can only be activated during one of your own Main Phases. Since “Karate Man’s” ATK would be over 1500 before you declare the attack, you definitely cannot attack after using “Karate Man’s” effect if “Messenger of Peace” is on the field. Similarly, as “Karate Man” is a Spell Speed 1 effect, it cannot be used during the opponent’s turn at all. So, if a “Gemini Elf” (for example) attacks your “Karate Man,” you don’t get to use the effect and “Karate Man” is destroyed from battle. Steve Okegawa, 01/07/2004</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monsters with ATK 1400 or less that are already on the field when “King Tiger Wanghu” is Summoned are not destroyed. “King Tiger Wanghu”’s effect only applies to monsters Summoned while it is face-up on the field.</li>
  <li>When a monster is Flip Summoned or flipped face-up by a card effect, it is not destroyed by the effect of “King Tiger Wanghu”.</li>
  <li>“King Tiger Wanghu”’s effect applies to both sides of the field.</li>
  <li>When “King Tiger Wanghu” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Cyber Jar”, other monsters with ATK 1400 or less that are Special Summoned by the same “Cyber Jar” are destroyed if they are Special Summoned in face-up Attack Position.</li>
  <li>If a monster’s ATK when it is Summoned is less than 1400 due to the effect of other cards, such as a Field Spell Card that reduces its ATK, it is destroyed by “King Tiger Wanghu”’s effect (so apply all existing modifiers before determining if the monster is destroyed). If “Command Knight” is Summoned, it increases its own ATK to 1600 before “King Tiger Wanghu” can destroy it.</li>
  <li>If “King Tiger Wanghu” is Normal Summoned or Special Summoned, and its own ATK is reduced below 1400 by a pre-existing effect, then it destroys itself when Summoned. (Example: “King Tiger Wanghu” and “Bladefly” are Special Summoned simultaneously by “Cyber Jar”. “King Tiger Wanghu”’s ATK is 1300, and it is destroyed by its own effect (and “Bladefly” is also destroyed by “King Tiger Wanghu”’s effect).</li>
  <li>Monsters that are Summoned face-down (like with “The Shallow Grave”) are not destroyed by King Tiger Wanghu.</li>
  <li>“King Tiger Wanghu”’s effect includes Monster Tokens with ATK 1400 or less.</li>
  <li>If “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field and “Marauding Captain” is Summoned, “Marauding Captain” can still activate its effect and Special Summon a monster even though “Marauding Captain” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field along with Trigger Effect monsters such as “Mysterious Puppeteer”, “Ryu-Kishin Clown”, “Sonic Bird”, and “Dragon Seeker”, then they form a chain.</li>
  <li>If “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field, and “Exiled Force” is Summoned, “King Tiger Wanghu”’s effect immediately activates. Since “Exiled Force” cannot be chained, “King Tiger Wanghu” will destroy “Exiled Force” before the turn player can Tribute “Exiled Force” using its effect.</li>

  <li>If “Tsukuyomi” is summoned while “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field, “Tsukuyomi” and “King Tiger Wanghu” will trigger at the same time. Since the turn player is summoning Tsukuyomi, it will be CL1 and “King Tiger Wanghu” will be CL2. This will result in “King Tiger Wanghu” destroying “Tsukuyomi” and then the effect of “Tsukuyomi” will resolve flipping the target face down.
    <ul>
      <li>If the player who is summoning “Tsukuyomi” is the same player who controls “King Tiger Wanghu”, that player can choose the order the effects are activated in since they are both mandatory effects that happen at the same time. The player can choose to have “King Tiger Wanghu” be CL1 and “Tsukuyomi” be CL2. This will result in “Tsukuyomi” resolving first and flipping “King Tiger Wanghu” face down. In this example, “Tsukuyomi” would live because “King Tiger Wanghu” must be face up on the field for its effect to resolve.</li>

<h4 id="last-turn">LAST TURN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Last Turn” is a very special Trap Card with very special and unusual rules. The most important thing to understand about “Last Turn” is that not all of its effects are applied when the Trap Card resolves. When “Last Turn” (the Trap Card itself) resolves, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards on the field and in both players’ hands are sent to the Graveyard. That is all that happens when “Last Turn” resolves. After that, the turn player Special Summons 1 monster from their Deck. After that, a special Battle Phase occurs. Then, during the End Phase, the victory check of “Last Turn” is applied. “Last Turn” sets up several effects that resolve later in the turn long after the Trap Card itself has resolved. Several other cards do this too, like “Last Will” and “Change of Heart”.</li>
  <li>Suppose that “Ceasefire” is activated (Chain Link 1), and “Last Turn” is chained to it (Chain Link 2). In this case, “Last Turn” resolves first, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards are sent to the Graveyard. Then resolve the effect of “Ceasefire” (Chain Link 1). After “Ceasefire” resolves, the turn player Special Summons a monster for “Last Turn”, then the special Battle Phase occurs, then in the End Phase the victory check is applied. This is an example of how the special nature of “Last Turn” works: the only thing that happens when “Last Turn” resolves is to select 1 monster and send all other cards to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>“Last Turn” is not a card that Special Summons a monster when it resolves. Therefore you can activate “Last Turn” even while “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is face-up on the field. If the player activating “Last Turn” controls “Jowgen the Spiritualist” and selects it as the monster to keep, the opponent cannot Special Summon for “Last Turn”, and there will be no special Battle Phase. However the victory check is still applied in the End Phase.</li>
  <li>The special Battle Phase for “Last Turn” happens right after the monster is Special Summoned. It is in addition to the normal Battle Phase and does not disrupt the normal order of the turn. For example, if “Last Turn” is activated during the Draw Phase, resolves the effect, Special Summon, initiate the special Battle Phase, then continue with the Draw Phase. The turn player can have a normal Battle Phase later in the turn.</li>
  <li>The special Battle Phase is treated like a standard Battle Phase in every other way, with a Start Step, Battle Step, Damage Step, and End Step. Only the selected monster and the Special Summoned monster can battle.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “The Rock Spirit” or “Soul of Purity and Light” their effects will be applied during your opponent’s special Battle Phase. Also any Flip Effects are resolved as normal, etc. You can use the effect of “Injection Fairy Lily” and other monster effects during the special Battle Phase.</li>
  <li>The effect that reduces Battle Damage to zero applies only for the special Battle Phase, not for the normal Battle Phase. Example: A player activates “Last Turn” and selects their Defense Position “Spirit Reaper”. The turn player Special Summons “Enraged Battle Ox” and attacks in the special Battle Phase, but no damage occurs. However, during the turn player’s normal Battle Phase they can attack again, and will inflict 1500 points of damage due to the effect of “Enraged Battle Ox”, so the opponent’s Life Points will be zero and the turn player will win.</li>
  <li>If the Battle Phase is skipped because of “Thunder of Ruler” or “Soul Exchange”, resolve the effects of “Last Turn” as much as possible (including victory check, quite possibly resulting in a DRAW).</li>
  <li>You can chain to the activation of “Last Turn” with cards like “Ring of Destruction”, “Offerings to the Doomed”, or “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to eliminate the opponent’s monsters. If the player who activated “Last Turn” has no monsters on the field when it resolves, the effects of “Last Turn” are not negated. So the turn player still Special Summons a monster, although the special Battle Phase is not conducted, but the victory check in the End Phase is still performed.</li>
  <li>The victory check for “Last Turn” is an effect that must be resolved by the player who activated it. The turn player still has priority to activate and resolve any other effects first. You cannot chain to the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon “Dark Magician of Chaos” from your Deck, you can activate his effect to add a Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand.</li>
  <li>After “Last Turn” sends all cards to the Graveyard, before the Special Summon for “Last Turn” is performed, monster effects like “Despair from the Dark”, “Elephant Statue of Disaster”, and “Regenerating Mummy” will activate.</li>
  <li>If “Night Assailant” is sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of “Last Turn”, resolve the effect of “Night Assailant” before Special Summoning for “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon a monster that can attack twice, it can attack twice during the special Battle Phase (important if the opponent had a monster like “Big Core”).</li>
  <li>“Last Turn” as a chain to “Change of Heart”: Suppose the turn player activates “Change of Heart” and the opponent chains “Last Turn”, then the opponent selects the monster targeted by “Change of Heart” for “Last Turn” (since it’s still on his side of the field, as “Change of Heart” hasn’t resolved yet). Then “Change of Heart” resolves and the turn player gains control of the monster, then Special Summons for “Last Turn”. There is no special Battle Phase. Assuming that the opponent somehow survives the standard Battle Phase, during the End Phase, the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect. If the turn player activates and resolves “Change of Heart”, then the monster goes back to the opponent and (assuming nothing else has happened), both players each have 1 monster and the result is a DRAW. If the turn player passes priority to the opponent, the opponent can activate and resolve the effect of “Last Turn” before “Change of Heart”, and in this case the turn player still has 2 monsters and the opponent has zero, so the turn player would win. If the turn player passed priority to the opponent and the opponent passes it back, the turn player MUST activate and resolve an effect, so the effect of “Change of Heart” would expire and both players would have 1 monster each, resulting in a DRAW.</li>
  <li>You cannot Special Summon a monster for “Last Turn” that is a “Special Summon-only” monster like “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”, “Dark Necrofear”, or “Ocean Dragon Lord – Neo-Daedalus”. Nor can you select a Spirit Monster because they cannot be Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>You CAN Special Summon a high-level monster that has no Special Summoning restrictions for “Last Turn”, such as “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” or “Dark Magician of Chaos”.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your face-up “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”, the turn player cannot attack so unless they can destroy your “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” with a card effect, each of you will have a monster during the End Phase and the Duel will end in a DRAW.</li>
  <li>While your Life Points are 1000 or less, you can activate “Last Turn” in any part of your opponent’s turn, except the Damage Step. You can even activate it during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Last Turn” is activated and the turn player has no monsters to Summon, there is no battle however the victory check is still applied.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Last Turn” during the Draw Phase or Standby Phase, and select your face-up “Jowgen the Spiritualist”, your opponent can still retrieve their “Sinister Serpent”, Summon it normally in Main Phase 1, and attack and destroy “Jowgen the Spiritualist” in the normal Battle Phase, then win the Duel in the End Phase because of the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>If “Jinzo” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Turn”, “Jinzo” does not negate the special Battle Phase or victory check because “Last Turn” has already resolved and been sent to the Graveyard, so it is no longer on the field for “Jinzo” to negate.</li>
  <li>If a player’s Life Points are reduced to zero during the special Battle Phase of “Last Turn”, or afterwards during the normal course of the turn, then that player loses. Example: “Giant Germ” is Special Summoned by the turn player and is destroyed as a result of battle, and the opponent had 500 or fewer Life Points when activating “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and then your Life Points increase above 1000 later, the effects of “Last Turn” are still applied.</li>
  <li>If the turn player Special Summons “Mystic Tomato” for “Last Turn”, and attacks, and “Mystic Tomato” is destroyed, its effect activates and a monster is Special Summoned, but that new monster cannot attack during the special Battle Phase. (But it can attack during the standard Battle Phase.)</li>
  <li>If the turn player Special Summons “Sangan” for “Last Turn”, and “Sangan” is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, then its effect is resolved. If the turn player hasn’t Normal Summoned a monster that turn, they can Summon the monster retrieved with “Sangan” during their Main Phase (and attack during their standard Battle Phase). This can result in a DRAW.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “Dark Necrofear”, and it’s destroyed during the special Battle Phase, you can select which effect resolves first during the End Phase: “Dark Necrofear” or “Last Turn”. So you can choose to resolve “Dark Necrofear” first, equip it to your opponent’s monster and take control of it, then resolve “Last Turn” and win because only you control a monster.</li>
  <li>Vs. “Sanga of the Thunder”, “Kazejin”, “Suijin”: If the turn player Special Summons any of these monsters for “Last Turn”, he cannot activate the effect. However, if the player who activates “Last Turn” selects one of these monsters, he can activate the effect during the special Battle Phase.</li>
  <li>The monster selected by the player activating “Last Turn” can be face-up or face-down, in Attack or Defense Position.</li>
  <li>If the turn player Special Summons “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and it is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, during the End Phase the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect first, so he can choose the effect of “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and Special Summon it to the field before the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>If the effect of “Non Aggression Area” is being applied and you activate “Last Turn”, your opponent does not Special Summon from the Deck for “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>“Last Turn” does not target so you can select monsters like “Tyrant Dragon” and “Fiend Skull Dragon” for its effect, or a Dragon-Type monster while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field. You can select “Spirit Reaper” and it will not be destroyed by its effect.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Last Turn” and select your opponent’s monster that you control with “Snatch Steal”. However, after selecting it, “Snatch Steal” is sent to the Graveyard so control of the monster returns to the turn player. The turn player then Special Summons for “Last Turn” but no special Battle Phase is conducted. The victory check is still conducted in the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select a monster that was Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted”, when “Call of the Haunted” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, your selected monster is destroyed. But if you selected a monster Special Summoned by “Premature Burial”, the selected monster is not destroyed when “Premature Burial” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>If both monsters that battle for “Last Turn” are removed from play (such as with “D.D. Warrior Lady”) then the result is a DRAW.</li>
  <li>If “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” battles a monster for “Last Turn”, its effect is applied and it is not destroyed if it battles a monster with 1900 or higher ATK.</li>
  <li>“Waboku” can be activated before “Last Turn”, or be chained to the activation of “Last Turn”, and in either case the effect of “Waboku” will prevent the activator’s monster from being destroyed. This can lead to a DRAW.</li>
  <li>If the turn player activated “Last Will” before “Last Turn” was activated, a monster can be Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Will” during the special Battle Phase (but it cannot attack during the special Battle Phase).</li>
  <li>You can activate “Wall of Revealing Light” (paying its cost) and chain “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>If “Pyramid of Light”, “Andro Sphinx”, and “Sphinx Teleia” are all sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, “Theinen the Great Sphinx” is not Special Summoned because the effect of “Pyramid of Light” activates its effect, but then looks for “Andro Sphinx” and “Sphinx Teleia” and does not find them on the field, so it cannot destroy them with its effect.</li>
  <li>If the battle for “Last Turn” is conducted and the defending monster was “Wall of Illusion”, but it is destroyed, the attacking monster is returned to the turn player’s hand. The turn player can then Normal Summon the monster in the Main Phase (unless it has passed).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="last-will">LAST WILL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You don’t select a monster as a target when you activate or resolve “Last Will”. “Last Will” creates a state whereby, the next time during that turn when your monster is sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard, you may Special Summon 1 monster from your Deck using “Last Will’s” state. “Last Will’s” state then ends.</li>
  <li>These states accumulate, so if you activate 2 “Last Wills”, then the next time during that turn when your monster is sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard, you may Special Summon 2 monsters from your Deck, and the “Last Wills’” states then end.</li>
  <li>You only Special Summon 1 monster for each 1 “Last Will”.</li>
  <li>The state will expire at the end of the turn, or when it is used, whichever comes first. So if you Special Summon using “Last Will’s” state, then the state is gone, and if the end of the turn arrives without using “Last Will’s” state, then the state is gone.</li>
  <li>Last Will’s state will trigger by Tributing for a Tribute Summon, or for “Cannon Soldier’s” effect, etc.</li>
  <li>You can use “Last Will’s” state to Special Summon a Level 5 or higher monster like “Labyrinth Wall”.</li>
  <li>You cannot Special Summon a “Special Summon-only” monster. You CAN Special Summon “Toon Mermaid” with “Last Will’s” effect, as long as you have “Toon World” on your side of the field.</li>
  <li>“Last Will’s” state is only triggered when your OWN monster is sent from YOUR side of the field to YOUR Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Last Will’s” state is triggered during the Battle Phase by your monster being sent to your Graveyard, you resolve “Last Will’s” effect at that time (just like “Giant Rat”) and the newly Summoned monster can attack before Main Phase 2.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” is activated after “Last Will” has resolved, it will not negate “Last Will’s” state.</li>
  <li>You can Special Summon a 1500 ATK monster that will have higher than 1500 ATK after being Summoned, such as a Fiend with 1500 original ATK while “Yami” is on the field and its ATK once Summoned will be 1700.</li>
  <li>You can Special Summon “Muka Muka” even if you have 6 cards in your hand and “Muka Muka’s” ATK, once Summoned, will be higher than 1500.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Last Will” must be activated before the monster is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>“Last Will” only applies for the Turn it is played in.</li>
  <li>“Last Will” will only trigger when your monster is sent to your Graveyard. “Last Will” does not trigger if Tokens are sent to the Graveyard. For each “Last Will” played, one monster will be Special Summoned if a monster goes from the field to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>Monsters sent to the Graveyard in the Battle Phase of a turn “Last Will” has been activated are Special Summoned in that Battle Phase and if in Attack position may attack.</li>
  <li>“Last Will’s” effect can trigger in the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If a monster that has a[n optional] Graveyard effect is sent to the Graveyard the same Turn “Last Will” was played, the controlling player may choose the order the effects resolve in.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lava-golem">LAVA GOLEM</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Lava Golem” must be Special Summoned to your opponent’s side of the field using its effect text; you cannot Special Summon it or Tribute Summon it to your side of the field.</li>
  <li>However, if Special Summoned correctly and then sent to the Graveyard, you can use “Monster Reborn” to Special Summon “Lava Golem” to your side of the field, but you (as the controller) will then take the 1000 damage during your Standby Phases.</li>
  <li>You cannot Summon or Set and then Special Summon Lava Golem.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon “Lava Golem” onto your opponent’s side of the field they can activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” since you performed the Summon. You could not activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” even though the “Lava Golem” will be on their side of the field.</li>
  <li>You can Tribute “Sheep Tokens” to Special Summon “Lava Golem” because it is not a Tribute Summon.</li>
  <li>Since Tributed monsters are not considered to be targeted, you can use “Lava Golem” and Tribute your opponent’s Dragons even if he has “Lord of D.” on the field.</li>
  <li>You cannot Special Summon “Lava Golem” if the opponent has “Jowgen the Spiritualist” face-up on the field, nor can you Tribute their “Jowgen the Spiritualist” to Special Summon “Lava Golem”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Lava Golem’s” condition preventing Normal Summons and Sets during the turn “Lava Golem” was Special Summoned applies even if “Lava Golem” is Special Summoned from the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Remove Brainwashing” is on the field, “Lava Golem” will change control to the owner’s side of the field.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, the 1000 Damage inflicted by “Lava Golem” every Standby Phase is negated. If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, the condition preventing Normal Summons and Sets the turn “Lava Golem” is Special Summoned is not negated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="legacy-hunter">LEGACY HUNTER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your “Legacy Hunter” attacks your monster (controlled by your opponent) on your opponent’s side of the field, “Legacy Hunter’”s effect still activates and your opponent returns a card to the Deck.</li>
  <li>If “Legacy Hunter” attacks a face-down “Man-Eater Bug” or “Cyber Jar”, “Legacy Hunter”’s effect is not applied because “Legacy Hunter”’s effect activates when the monster he destroyed is sent to the Graveyard, and “Legacy Hunter” will no longer be on the field in these instances.</li>
  <li>The monster that “Legacy Hunter” attacks must be face-down at the start of the Damage Step for “Legacy Hunter’s” effect to activate. So if “Legacy Hunter” attacks a face-down Defense Position monster and your opponent activates “Ceasefire” to flip the monster face-up, “Legacy Hunter’s” effect is NOT applied. Also, if “Legacy Hunter” attacks a face-up monster and “Book of Moon” flips it face-down, “Legacy Hunter’s” effect DOES apply.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="legendary-black-belt">LEGENDARY BLACK BELT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Legendary Black Belt” inflicts damage based on the original DEF of the destroyed monster (in the Graveyard).</li>
  <li>If a monster equipped with “Legendary Black Belt” is destroyed, no damage is inflicted by the effect of “Legendary Black Belt” because it is no longer on the field. This includes if it attacked a monster with equal ATK, for example.</li>
  <li>After the monster is sent to the Graveyard after being destroyed as a result of battle, the effect of “Legendary Black Belt” that inflicts effect damage can be chained to.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="legendary-flame-lord">LEGENDARY FLAME LORD</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Legendary Flame Lord” gets Spell Counters when Spell Cards resolve, not when they are activated.</li>
  <li>If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Legendary Flame Lord”, “Legendary Flame Lord” does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because “Legendary Flame Lord” must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="legendary-jujitsu-master">LEGENDARY JUJITSU MASTER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Legendary Jujitsu Master” is destroyed, removed from play, or flipped face-down by the effect of the monster he battles with, “Legendary Jujitsu Master”’s effect is still applied and the monster is returned to the top of the Deck.</li>
  <li>If “Legendary Jujitsu Master” is changed to a Fiend-Type or a Zombie-Type by “DNA Surgery” and is attacked by “Getsu Fuhma”, “Getsu Fuhma”’s effect is Step 1 of a chain because the turn player is Step 1, and “Legendary Jujitsu Master” is Step 2. “Legendary Jujitsu Master” resolves first and “Getsu Fuhma” is sent back to the top of the Deck, then “Getsu Fuhma”’s effect resolves and “Legendary Jujitsu Master” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you have “Destruction Punch”’s effect, and your opponent attacks your “Legendary Jujitsu Master”, you resolve the 2 effects in a chain with the controller (the defending player) choosing the order.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lekunga">LEKUNGA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot activate “Lekunga”’s effect if you do not have a vacant Monster Card Zone on your side of the field.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lesser-fiend">LESSER FIEND</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monsters destroyed by this card as a result of battle are not sent to the Graveyard, so “Sangan” or “Mystic Tomato” would not have their effects activated, and the effect of “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer” will not prevent them from being removed from play.</li>
  <li>This card does not negate the effects of monsters it destroys as a result of battle, so a Flip Effect like “Cyber Jar” or Trigger Effect like “D.D. Warrior Lady” will still be activated. “Cyber Jar” would still be removed from play in this example, since damage calculation occurs normally.</li>
  <li>If “Lesser Fiend” battles with “Relinquished” equipped with a Monster Card, and that equipped card is destroyed instead of “Relinquished”, it is not removed from play since it is the effect of “Relinquished” that destroyed it and not as a result of battle with “Lesser Fiend”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="level-conversion-lab">LEVEL CONVERSION LAB</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you resolve the effect of “Level Conversion Lab”, show the card to your opponent then roll the die.</li>
  <li>The Level of a monster can go up or down with “Level Conversion Lab”.</li>
  <li>If “Cost Down” resolves and lowers the Levels of monsters in your hand, then you use “Level Conversion Lab”, the effect of “Level Conversion Lab” overwrites the effect of “Cost Down”. But if you resolve “Level Conversion Lab” first, and then activate and resolve “Cost Down”, “Cost Down” will lower whatever the result was from ”Level Conversion Lab”.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Level Conversion Lab” and change “Levia-Dragon Daedalus” to a Level 5 monster, and “A Legendary Ocean” is on the field, then “Levia-Dragon Daedalus” is Level 4.</li>
  <li>If you use “Level Conversion Lab” to change “The Masked Beast” to Level 3, you still need to Tribute 8 Levels worth of monsters for “Curse of the Masked Beast” or “Contract with the Abyss”.</li>
  <li>The Level change from “Level Conversion Lab” lasts until the end of the turn, even if the monster is Summoned. So if you change “Summoned Skull” to Level 3, and Summon it, it can attack even if “Gravity Bind” is active.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="level-limit---area-b">LEVEL LIMIT - AREA B</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Level Limit - Area B” does not use the chain, it is a continuous effect.</li>
  <li>All Level 4 or higher monsters face-up on the field after “Level Limit - Area B” resolves will be in Defense Position. You can change the Battle Position of a Level 4 or higher monster, but it will immediately be changed back to Defense Position because of “Level Limit - Area B”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If “Level Limit - Area B” is activated while “Final Attack Orders” is active, then the most recently resolved effect takes precedence and monsters Level 4 or higher will be in Defense Position.</li>
  <li>If you Summon “Spell Canceller” while “Level Limit - Area B” is on the field, “Spell Canceller” negates its effect and is not changed to Defense Position.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="levia-dragon---daedalus">LEVIA-DRAGON - DAEDALUS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can send “A Legendary Ocean” to the Graveyard to activate “Levia-Dragon Daedalus”’ effect, but you can’t send “Maiden of the Aqua”.</li>
  <li>You can’t send a face-down “Umi” or “A Legendary Ocean” to activate “Levia-Dragon Daedalus”’ effect.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Levia-Dragon Daedalus”’ effect and your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” to destroy “Levia-Dragon Daedalus”, “Levia-Dragon Daedalus”’ effect still resolves even though it has been destroyed.</li>
  <li>When “Book of Moon” is chained to “Levia-Dragon Daedalus”’ effect to flip it face-down, the effect still resolves, but “Levia-Dragon Daedalus” is destroyed by its own effect, since it’s no longer “this card”, it’s just “a card”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sending “Umi” to the Graveyard is the Cost of activating the effect of “Levia-Dragon - Daedalus.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="life-absorbing-machine">LIFE ABSORBING MACHINE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The total Life Points you paid” is defined as the Life Points paid for costs (both activation costs and maintenance costs) of cards. It does not include damage or loss of Life Points. Damage is not included even if the damage was caused by an effect you control, such as if you activate “Ring of Destruction”.</li>
  <li>“In your last turn” is defined as the period from the start of your previous turn’s Draw Phase to the end of that turn’s End Phase. Cost that you paid during your opponent’s turn that occurred between your last turn and the current turn are not included.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Life Absorbing Machine” increases your Life Points for each cost you paid separately. So if you had “Fire Princess” on the field, and you paid 2 costs during your last turn, “Fire Princess” will deal 1000 points of damage to the opponent.</li>
  <li>“Life Absorbing Machine” does not have to be active at the time the Life Points were paid. If you pay a cost of 2000 Life Points during your turn, then activate “Life Absorbing Machine” during your opponent’s turn, the effect of “Life Absorbing Machine” will increase your Life Points by 1000 during your Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>Example: It is your turn. During your Standby Phase you pay 500 Life Points for your “Terrorking Archfiend”. During your Main Phase 1 you activate “Life Absorbing Machine”. Then you activate “Delinquent Duo” and pay 1000 Life Points for its cost. You Set “Seven Tools of the Bandit” and end your turn. During your opponent’s turn they activate “Reinforcements” and you chain “Seven Tools of the Bandit” to negate and destroy it. Your opponent ends their turn. During your Standby Phase the effect of “Life Absorbing Machine” increases your Life Points by 250 (half of “Terrorking Archfiend”’s cost) then again by 500 (half of “Delinquent Duo”’s cost).</li>
  <li>If you have two copies of “Life Absorbing Machine” on the field, their effects are cumulative.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="light-of-intervention">LIGHT OF INTERVENTION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>The effect of this card applies to both players, and does not affect monsters that are already on the field face-down. These monsters remain face-down until flipped face-up as normal.</li>
  <li>While this card is on the field, monsters can be Normal Summoned in face-up Defense Position, and can be the target of “Trap Hole” and will trigger effects like the effect of “Mysterious Puppeteer”.</li>
  <li>While this card is on the field, if a monster would be Special Summoned in face-down Defense Position (such as with “Cyber Jar” or “Nimble Momonga”), it is instead Special Summoned in face-up Defense Position.</li>
  <li>While this card is on the field you cannot flip a monster face-down with “Book of Moon”, “Darkness Approaches”, etc.</li>
</ul>

  <li>A second “Limiter Removal” will double the effect of the first “Limiter Removal.”</li>
  <li>If an effect that changes the ATK value of a monster before it was affected by “Limiter Removal” is later removed, the ATK of the affected monster is not changed.</li>
  <li>If an effect that changes the ATK value of a monster after it has been affected by “Limiter Removal,” the ATK value of that monster will be altered.</li>
  <li>If the monster affected by “Limiter Removal” is removed from the field or turned face-down, the monster is not destroyed by the effect of “Limiter Removal” at the end of the turn and the ATK value of the affected monster resets.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="lone-wolf">LONE WOLF</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you activate “Lone Wolf” targeting an appropriate monster, and later you Summon another monster, the effect of “Lone Wolf” is still applied.</li>
  <li>If you target “Monk Fighter”, etc. with “Lone Wolf”, and “Monk Fighter” is later flipped face-down, the effect of “Lone Wolf” disappears and is not re-activated even if “Monk Fighter” is later flipped face-up again.</li>
  <li>“Your opponent’s monster effects” on “Lone Wolf” means “the effects of monsters that your opponent controls”. So if your opponent uses “Monster Reborn” on your “Exiled Force”, they still cannot Tribute “Exiled Force” to destroy your “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”.</li>
  <li>If you Summon “Monk Fighter” and target it with “Lone Wolf”, and your opponent controls “Bug-Tusked Mammoth”, you can still attack that same turn with “Monk Fighter”.</li>
  <li>If your “Master Monk” targeted with “Lone Wolf” attacks and destroys “D.D. Assailant”, “D.D. Assailant” is removed from play but “Master Monk” is not.</li>
  <li>If your opponent Summons “Dark Jeroid” and reduces your “Monk Fighter” ATK by 800 points, then later you activate “Lone Wolf” targeting the “Monk Fighter”, it does not restore the ATK of “Monk Fighter”.</li>
  <li>Your “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf” cannot be destroyed by the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus”. Furthermore, if it is the only monster on your side of the field, your opponent cannot discard cards to activate “Tribe-Infecting Virus” to destroy Rock-Type monsters, because it will have no effect.</li>
  <li>If you have “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”, the following are examples of monster effects that will NOT be negated because they are not applied to a monster: “Airknight Parshath” (damage is inflicted and a card is drawn), “Fiber Jar” (“Monk Fighter” is shuffled into the Deck), “Maju Garzett” (the ATK of “Maju Garzett” does not become 0), “Susa Soldier” (the damage to Life Points is still halved), “Dark Magician Girl” (her ATK is still increased by her effect), “Stone Statue of the Aztecs” (Battle Damage to your Life Points is doubled), “Amazoness Fighter” (opponent’s Battle Damage to their Life Points is still zero), “Amazoness Swords Woman” (Battle Damage is still redirected), and “Reflect Bounder” (you still take effect damage to your Life Points).</li>
  <li>“Archfiend of Gilfer” and “Dark Necrofear” in the Graveyard can activate their effects and target “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”. This is because they activate as Monster Cards, equip to the target monster, become treated as Equip Spell Cards, and THEN apply their effects (by which point they are now treated as Equip Spell Cards).</li>
  <li>The effect of “Lone Wolf” will be negated by Jinzo even if targeting “Monk Fighter”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lord-of-d">LORD OF D.</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Lord of D.” cannot negate effects; he only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as targets of effects. Once a target has been selected, the effect of “Lord of D.” is irrelevant.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates “Ring of Destruction” targeting your “Lord of D.” and you chain “D. Tribe” to change “Lord of D.” to Dragon-Type, “Ring of Destruction” will still resolve and destroy “Lord of D.” since he was selected as a target before he was changed into Dragon-Type. If your opponent activates “Ring of Destruction” targeting a Dragon-Type monster you control and you chain “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Lord of D.” from your Graveyard, your Dragon-Type monster is still destroyed for the same reason.</li>
  <li>If you have “Lord of D.” on the field, and activate “Premature Burial” to Special Summon a Dragon-Type monster from your Graveyard, that is okay, but if your opponent later destroys “Premature Burial” your Dragon-Type monster is also destroyed because “Premature Burial” is NOT selecting your Dragon-Type as a target.</li>
  <li>While you have “Lord of D.” on the field you cannot equip your Dragon-Type monsters with Equip Spell Cards, but if you already have a Dragon-Type monster equipped with an Equip Spell Card when you Summon “Lord of D.”, the Equip Spell card is not destroyed or negated, because “Lord of D.” only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as a target.</li>
  <li>“Lord of D.” will NOT stop “Dark Hole”, “Mirror Force”, “Raigeki”, “Fissure”, “Smashing Ground”, “Hammer Shot”, or “Amazoness Archers”, nor will he protect your Dragon-Type monsters from their effects, since these cards affect the whole field and do not select targets.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lord-poison">LORD POISON</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No card called “Lord Poison” can be Special Summoned by “Lord Poison”’s effect; either the one that was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, or another copy of “Lord Poison” that was already in the Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lost-guardian">LOST GUARDIAN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whenever the number of your monsters removed from play changes, re-calculate the DEF of “Lost Guardian”. (Just like “Shadow Ghoul”, etc.)</li>
  <li>When a monster is removed from play, it goes to a “removed zone” (for lack of a better term) of the original owner. If the opponent controlled it, it will return to the opponent’s side of the field when it returns to player, however it is considered to be in the original owner’s “removed zone” while out of play. This is important for effects such as “Lost Guardian”.</li>
  <li>Example: Player A controls 2 monsters. Player B activates “Change of Heart” to take control of one of them, then activates “Different Dimension Gate” to remove both from play. Both monsters are in Player A’s “removed zone” while removed from play (so Player A’s “Lost Guardian” would have 1400 DEF). When “Different Dimension Gate” is destroyed, the monster Player B took control of will return to Player B’s side of the field (if possible, if not it is destroyed) before returning to Player A’s side of the field.</li>
  <li>Monsters removed from play and kept face-down, like with “Different Dimension Capsule” or “Lightforce Sword”, do NOT count towards the DEF of “Lost Guardian”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="luminous-soldier">LUMINOUS SOLDIER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the ATK of “Luminous Soldier” is reduced to 0 because of the effect of “Fairy Box” the ATK will increase by 500 points in the Damage Step if it is battling with a DARK monster.</li>
  <li>If the attack target of “Luminous Soldier” is redirected to a DARK monster by the effect of “Dreamsprite” the ATK of “Luminous Soldier” will then increase by 500 points.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="machine-duplication">MACHINE DUPLICATION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a monster on the field, with an ATK of 500 or less, is changed to Machine-Type with “DNA Surgery”, you can use “Machine Duplication” to Special Summon up to 2 copies of it from your Deck.</li>
  <li>The Machine-Type monster is chosen at activation of this card, so if the opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” to destroy the chosen monster, up to 2 copies of that card can still be Special Summoned.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mage-power">MAGE POWER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Mage Power” includes itself, Field Spell Cards on your side of the field, and monsters acting like Equip Spell Cards, such as Union Monsters.</li>
  <li>If you control “Cannon Soldier” equipped with “Mage Power”, and you activate “Limiter Removal”, then the ATK of “Cannon Soldier” is (1400 + 500 + 500) x 2 = 4800.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Mage Power” counts itself toward its effect. (Example: if you Equip this Spell Card to your monster and “Mage Power” is the only Spell Card in your Spell and Trap Card Zone, the equipped monster would increase its ATK and DEF by 500 points.)</li>
  <li>A Field Spell Card in your Field Spell Card Zone is included in the effect of your “Mage Power.</li>
  <li>It does not matter if the Spell and/or Trap card(s) on your side of the field are face-up or face-down.</li>
  <li>The only Spell and Trap cards included in the effect of “Mage Power” are the ones controlled by the person that is in control of the “Mage Power.” If your opponent takes control of your monster that is equipped with your “Mage Power,” “Mage Power” would still only count the Spell and Trap Cards on your side of the field. So if I have a Gemini Elf equipped with “Mage Power” and 2 Set Spell/Trap Cards and my opponent takes control of the equipped “Gemini Elf,” they would not count how many Spell and Trap cards are on their side of the field. Only the ones on my side of the field would be included in the effect of “Mage Power.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="magic-cylinder">MAGIC CYLINDER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Magic Cylinder” negates the attack of one attacking monster, but that monster is still considered to have attacked and may not attack again or have its Battle Position manually changed.</li>
  <li>Monsters that may attack twice during the Battle Phase, such as “Hayabusa Knight”, that have their first attack negated by the effect of “Magic Cylinder” may still make a second attack.</li>
  <li>If the attack of “Goblin Attack Force” or “Spear Dragon” is negated by the effect of “Magic Cylinder”, they will not be changed to Defense Position, since Damage Calculation never occurred.</li>
  <li>The Damage caused by this card’s effect is equal to the current ATK of the attacking monster.</li>
  <li>If an effect is chained to “Magic Cylinder” that destroys the attacking monster, or removes the attacking monster from the turn player’s side of the field (including switching it to your control, or sending it to the owner’s hand), no damage is dealt by the effect of “Magic Cylinder”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Magic Cylinder” negates the attack before it reaches the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>“Magic Cylinder” is considered a targeting effect.</li>

<h4 id="magic-jammer">MAGIC JAMMER</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Magic Jammer” may only be activated in a chain to the initial activation of “Wave Motion Cannon.” “Magic Jammer” may not be activated in a response to the action of Tributing “Wave Motion Cannon.”</li>
  <li>“Magic Jammer” must be activated in a chain with the activation of “Double Spell.” If “Double Spell” has successfully resolved, “Magic Jammer” may not be used to negate the activation of the Spell activated through the effect of “Double Spell.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="magic-reflector">MAGIC REFLECTOR</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can put 2 or more counters on a Spell Card if you activate 2 or more “Magic Reflectors”. When the Spell Card is destroyed, remove the counters on it 1-by-1.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Magic Reflector” and put a counter on a Monster Card equipped to “Relinquished”, and if the equipped card would be destroyed, remove 1 counter instead.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” is active, and if a Spell Card with a counter on it would be destroyed, the counter is removed instead. “Imperial Order” does not negate the function of counters created by the effect of “Magic Reflector”.</li>
  <li>If a Spell Card with a maintenance cost has a counter on it, such as “Messenger of Peace”, and you choose not to pay the cost, the Spell Card is still destroyed.</li>
  <li>If a Field Spell Card has a counter on it and a player activates a new Field Spell Card, the Field Spell Card with the counter is still destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Swords of Revealing Light” has a counter on it, it is still destroyed at the end of the opponent’s third turn after it was activated.</li>
  <li>If you use “Magic Reflector” to place a counter on a Union Monster that is an Equip Card, and the Union Monster would be destroyed instead of the equipped monster, remove the “Magic Reflector” counter from the Union Monster instead, and the Union Monster is not destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Magic Reflector” does not produce a Spell Counter for the purposes of cards that use Spell Counters.</li>
  <li>“Magic Reflector” will not prevent the affected Spell Card from being sent to the Graveyard if it was not destroyed.</li>
  <li>“Magic Reflector” will not prevent the affected Spell Card from returning to the hand as that action does not destroy the Spell Card.</li>

<h4 id="magical-marionette">MAGICAL MARIONETTE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no limit to the number of Spell Counters you can have on “Magical Marionette”.</li>
  <li>Removing Spell Counters from “Magical Marionette” to use its effect is a cost.</li>
  <li>You can use “Magical Marionette”’s effect multiple times in the same turn, as long as you have enough Spell Counters to pay the cost.</li>
  <li>You can destroy “Magical Marionette” with its own effect.</li>
  <li>If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Magical Marionette”, “Magical Marionette” does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because “Magical Marionette” must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Magical Marionette” constantly checks the number of Spell Counters on it for the purposes of calculating ATK.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="magical-scientist">MAGICAL SCIENTIST</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use “Magical Scientist”’s effect multiple times in the same turn.</li>
  <li>“Magical Scientist”’s effect does not target.</li>
  <li>If the Fusion Monster is flipped face-down with “Book of Moon”, or removed from play with “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Different Dimension Gate”, the effect is reset and the Fusion Monster does not go back to the Fusion Deck, and is not prohibited from attacking your opponent’s Life Points directly.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon “Reaper on the Nightmare” with “Magical Scientist”, it cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly (but can attack a monster).</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Secret Pass to the Treasures” targeting a Fusion Monster Special Summoned with “Magical Scientist” because it cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly that turn.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is activated after a Fusion Monster is Special Summoned with “Magical Scientist”, the effect of “Magical Scientist” (that makes the Fusion Monster unable to attack directly and have to go back to the Fusion Deck) has been applied already, and is not negated, so the Special Summoned Fusion Monster still cannot attack directly and must go back to the Fusion Deck.</li>
  <li>If “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is on the field, you cannot activate the effect of “Magical Scientist” (so you cannot even pay the cost to try and activate “Last Turn”, for example).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="magical-thorn">MAGICAL THORN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have two copies of “Magical Thorn” active on the field, your opponent will take 1000 points of damage whenever they discard a card. If you have three copies, they will take 1500 points of damage.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Magical Thorn” is applied when the opponent discards during the End Phase to make their hand size 6, discarding for the cost of cards such as “Tribute to the Doomed”, “Cost Down”, or “Judgment of Anubis”, and discarding for card effects such as “Delinquent Duo”, “Confiscation”, “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Morphing Jar” and “Mefist the Infernal General”.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Magical Thorn” is NOT applied when you send cards from your hand to the Graveyard for things such as a Tribute for a Ritual Spell Card, a Fusion Material Monster, or the effects of cards like “Chosen One” or “Gravekeeper’s Watcher”.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Magical Thorn” is NOT applied when cards in your hand are destroyed by “Chain Destruction” or when cards are sent from the Deck to Graveyard by the effect of “Painful Choice”. It is also NOT applied when cards in your hand are removed from play by the effect of “Lightforce Sword”.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Magical Thorn” is only applied when a card is discarded from your opponent’s hand to your opponent’s Graveyard. So if they have your card in your hand by the effect of “Exchange” or “Graverobber” and they discard it, they do not take any damage from the effect of “Magical Thorn”.</li>
  <li>If the opponent discards from their hand as a cost to activate a card like “Cost Down” and you chain “Magical Thorn” they will not take any damage. If your opponent activates a card where discarding is part of the effect of the card, such as “Card Destruction”, and you chain “Magical Thorn”, they WILL take damage because the effect of “Magical Thorn” will be active before the discarding effect resolves.</li>
  <li>“Magical Thorn” deals damage per card, so if the opponent activates “Graceful Charity” they will take 1000 points of damage when they discard 2 cards. If they discard 5 cards to activate “Final Destiny” they take 2500 points of damage.</li>
  <li>Even though “Magical Thorn” does damage per card discarded, it deals the damage as one lump sum for effects like “Dark Room of Nightmare”.</li>
  <li>“Necrovalley” does not negate the effect of “Magical Thorn”.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Magical Thorn” inflicts damage after an effect resolves. So if the effect of “Morphing Jar” is activated, the damage will be dealt after the new cards are drawn. This means if your opponent has 100 Life Points, and you have “Magical Thorn” active on the field but only one card left in your Deck, you will lose the Duel before the effect of “Magical Thorn” can deal damage to reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0.</li>
  <li>“Magical Thorn” will deal damage between steps in a chain. For example, both you and your opponent have 100 Life Points remaining, your opponent has two cards in their hand and you have “Magical Thorn” active on the field and a Set “Mind Crush”. It is your opponent’s turn and they activate “Final Flame” to deal 600 points of damage to you, and you chain “Mind Crush” calling the “Sinister Serpent” you know they have in their hand. After Step 2 (“Mind Crush”) resolves, the effect of “Magical Thorn” deals 500 points of damage to your opponent and you win the Duel before Step 1, “Final Flame”, resolves.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="maharaghi">MAHARAGHI</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If two copies of “Maharaghi” had their effects activated, you resolve them one at a time. This means you look at 1 card, and if you place it back on top of your Deck, you will see it again for the second effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="maiden-of-the-aqua">MAIDEN OF THE AQUA</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Maiden of the Aqua” is active only when there is no face-up Field Spell Card on the field. When a Field Spell Card is activated after “Maiden of the Aqua” is Summoned, the effect of “Maiden of the Aqua” is negated as long as there is a face-up Field Spell Card. If the only Field Spell Card is face-down, the effect of “Maiden of the Aqua” is active. If there is a face-up Field Spell Card but it is negated by “Imperial Order”, the effect of “Maiden of the Aqua” is not active.</li>
  <li>If a Field Spell Card is already active, and “Maiden of the Aqua” is Summoned, the existing Field Spell Card continues to function and “Maiden of the Aqua”’s effect is not applied until there is no face-up Field Spell Card.</li>
  <li>While “Maiden of the Aqua” is making the field “Umi”, you can activate “Tornado Wall” but if “Maiden of the Aqua” is destroyed, “Tornado Wall” is also destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Maiden of the Aqua”, “Umi”, and “Tornado Wall” are all on your side of the field, and “Umi” is destroyed, “Tornado Wall” is not destroyed because “Maiden of the Aqua” treats the field as “Umi” as soon as “Umi” leaves play.</li>
  <li>If you have “Maiden of the Aqua” (with her effect active) and “The Legendary Fisherman” or “Deepsea Warrior” on your side of the field, and “Dark Hole” is activated, “The Legendary Fisherman” and “Deepsea Warrior” will not be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you have “Maiden of the Aqua” and “Tornado Wall” on the field, and “Maiden of the Aqua” is attacked by “Dark Driceratops” and Battle Damage would be inflicted, “Tornado Wall” still prevents the damage during damage calculation, as “Maiden of the Aqua” will remain on the field until the end of the Damage Step.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Maji-Gire Panda” is a Trigger Effect that activates when 1 or more Beast-Type monster(s) are destroyed. If the monsters were destroyed as a result of battle, the timing of this effect is at the end of the Damage Step, when the monsters are sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can chain to the activation of “Maji-Gire Panda”’s effect, including with “Divine Wrath”.</li>
  <li>If 2 or more Beast-Type monsters are destroyed at the same time, the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” only increases by 500 points.</li>
  <li>Beast-Type tokens like “Sheep Tokens” are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.</li>
  <li>Monsters changed to Beast-Type by “DNA Surgery” are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.</li>
  <li>Beast-Type monsters on your opponent’s side of the field are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.</li>
  <li>When face-down Beast-Type monsters are destroyed (by a card effect), the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” does not increase.</li>
  <li>The ATK increase from the effect of “Maji-Gire Panda” remains as long as “Maji-Gire Panda” remains face-up on the field.</li>

  <li>“Maju Garzett”’s ATK will be 0 if you Special Summon it, or Tribute Summon it with a monster with “?” ATK (such as “Gradius’ Option” or another “Maju Garzett”), or Tribute Summon it with only 1 Tribute using “Cost Down”, or equip it with “Megamorph”, or if it’s flipped face-down and then face-up again, or if you Tribute Summon it with Mirage Tokens, or if you remove it from play with “Dimensionhole” and it returns to the field.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active, “Maju Garzett”’s ATK is reset to 0 even if “Skill Drain” is later destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Maju Garzett” battles “Cat’s Ear Tribe”, its original ATK is changed to 200 for the battle, then after the battle its ATK is reset to 0.</li>
  <li>When you Tribute Monster Tokens to Tribute Summon “Maju Garzett”, the sum of their ATK’s will be the ATK of “Maju Garzett”.</li>
  <li>When you Tribute Summon “Maju Garzett”, your opponent can use “Trap Hole” or “Bottomless Trap Hole” if appropriate.</li>

<h4 id="malice-doll-of-demise">MALICE DOLL OF DEMISE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your opponent takes control of your “Malice Doll of Demise”, and sends it to the Graveyard by the effect of a Continuous Spell Card, you can still activate its effect to Special Summon it during your Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Malice Doll of Demise” is Tributed to activate the effect of “Mass Driver”, then “Malice Doll of Demise’s” effect does not activate because the Tribute is treated as a cost, not an effect.</li>
  <li>Examples of Continuous Spell Cards that would send “Malice Doll of Demise” from the field to the Graveyard by their effect include “Ectoplasmer” and “Continuous Destruction Punch”.</li>
  <li>You can only activate the Special Summoning effect of “Malice Doll of Demise” during your first Standby Phase after it was sent to the Graveyard by the effect of a Continuous Spell Card. If you miss that, you cannot then activate the Special Summoning effect later on. If there is no monster card zone at the appropriate time, the effect is activated but you cannot Special Summon the “Malice Doll of Demise”, so its effect disappears.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Malice Doll of Demise” activates in the Graveyard. If “The End of Anubis” is on the field during the Standby Phase in which “Malice Doll of Demise” would activate its effect, then the effect is negated and “Malice Doll of Demise” is not Special Summoned. If “The End of Anubis” leaves play after that, you still cannot activate “Malice Doll of Demise”’s effect because the opportunity has passed.</li>

  <li>Sending monsters to the Graveyard for “Manticore of Darkness”’ effect is a cost.</li>
  <li>You can’t send a Monster Token to the Graveyard for “Manticore of Darkness”’ effect because Monster Tokens are taken off the field instead of going to the Graveyard.</li>

<h4 id="marauding-captain">MARAUDING CAPTAIN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have 2 “Maurading Captains” on your side of the field, the opponent cannot attack any face-up Warrior-Type monsters you control. They can attack your Life Points directly if they control a monster with an effect that allows it (Such as “Rainbow Flower”, “Inaba White Rabbit”, or a Toon Monster). They could also attack a non-Warrior Type monster you control.</li>

  <li>If your opponent activates “Torrential Tribute” in response to the Summoning of “Maurading Captain” (by chaining to the Trigger Effect of “Marauding Captain”), all monsters on the field will be destroyed, and then you Special Summon for “Maurading Captain”’s effect. If they wait and activate “Torrential Tribute” in response to the Special Summoning of a monster for the effect of “Marauding Captain”, then all monsters will be destroyed including the newly-Special Summoned monster.</li>

  <li>Q: If my opponent attacks “Marauding Captain” on my side of the field can I activate “Shift” and redirect the attack to another Warrior-Type monster?<br />
A: The other monster is not a legal target for “Shift” in this case, because “Marauding Captain” will not allow it to be attacked. Curtis Schultz, 12/20/2003</li>

<h4 id="mask-of-restrict">MASK OF RESTRICT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fusion Material Monsters are not Tributes, so a Fusion Monster may be Special Summoned while this card is active on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Mask of Restrict” is chained to a Ritual Spell Card, the effect of the Spell Card cannot resolve and no monsters are Tributed from the hand or field.</li>
  <li>If “Mask of Restrict” is active, a Toon Monster that requires Tributes cannot be Special Summoned. The activation of “Mask of Restrict” cannot be chained to the Summoning of a Toon Monster, but it can be chained to the activation of “Toon World”.</li>
  <li>If “Mask of Restrict” is chained to the effect of “Cannon Soldier” you will still take damage because Tributing a monster is a cost of “Cannon Soldier” and is performed when the effect of “Cannon Soldier” is activated. If “Mask of Restrict” is chained to your opponent’s “Share the Pain” you do not have to Tribute a monster, but your opponent still does because it is a cost.</li>

  <li>If you use “Monster Reborn” on “Mataza the Zapper” while “Remove Brainwashing” is active, control of “Mataza the Zapper” does not return to the original owner.</li>
  <li>While “Skill Drain” is active, you can take control of “Mataza the Zapper” from your opponent.</li>

<h4 id="mazera-deville">MAZERA DEVILLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot use “Monster Reborn”, etc. on “Mazera DeVille” even if he is Special Summoned properly, because he “cannot be Special Summoned, EXCEPT by…”.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon “Mazera DeVille”, his effect activates, and your opponent chains “Mystical Space Typhoon” to destroy “Pandemonium” in a chain, “Mazera Deville”’s effect disappears because his effect needs “Pandemonium” on the field when the effect resolves, not just when it activates (just like “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”).</li>
  <li>If your opponent has less than 3 cards in his hand, he must discard his entire hand.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="megamorph">MEGAMORPH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Megamorph” changes the original ATK of the monster it is equipped to. Having multiple “Megamorphs” equipped to a monster is the same as having one.</li>
  <li>“Megamorph” is always recalculating with every change in Life Points. For example, your “Jirai Gumo” is equipped with “Megamorph” and you have 8000 Life Points compared to your 7000. You declare an attack with “Jirai Gumo” and lose the coin toss, losing 4000 Life Points. Now “Jirai Gumo”’s ATK is doubled before Damage Calculation.</li>
  <li>When Life Points are equal the equipped monster’s ATK is unchanged.</li>
  <li>You may equip “Megamorph” to your opponent’s monster, but ‘your Life Points’ refers to the controller of “Megamorph”. So if you have more Life Points than your opponent, your opponent’s monster equipped with “Megamorph” has its ATK halved.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="megarock-dragon">MEGAROCK DRAGON</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must remove from play at least 1 Rock-Type monster in your Graveyard in order to Special Summon “Megarock Dragon”.</li>
  <li>The original ATK of “Megarock Dragon” is determined by its effect. This is further doubled/halved by “Megamorph” and other effects that are based off of original ATK. So if you Special Summon “Megarock Dragon” with an original ATK of 2100 points, then equip it with “Megamorph”, its ATK will be 4200 or 1050 depending on your Life Points.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active while “Megarock Dragon” is in play, the effect of “Megarock Dragon” is negated and its original ATK and DEF are treated as zero. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed later, the original ATK and DEF of “Megarock Dragon” will remain zero.</li>
  <li>If “Megarock Dragon” is flipped face-down, or removed from play, or sent to the Graveyard, its effect is wiped and its original ATK and DEF are zero.</li>

<h4 id="metalmorph">METALMORPH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you equip two copies of “Metalmorph” to a single monster, its ATK and DEF will be increase by 600 and the second effect will add half of your attack target’s ATK to the equipped monster’s ATK twice.</li>
  <li>The second effect of this card only increases the equipped monster’s ATK when it is the attacking monster (during your Battle Phase) not when it is being attacked during your opponent’s Battle Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Reverse Trap” is activated, a monster equipped with “Metalmorph” will have its ATK and DEF decreased by 300 points, but the second effect of “Metalmorph” will be unaffected and still increase the equipped monster’s ATK by an amount equal to half of the attacked monster’s ATK.</li>

  <li>When you have a monster equipped with “Metalsilver Armor”, your opponent CAN activate the effect of “Nimble Momonga” or “Giant Germ” because their effects do not target 1 card.</li>
  <li>When you have a monster equipped with “Metalsilver Armor”, your opponent CAN activate “Reinforcement of the Army”.</li>
  <li>When you have a monster equipped with “Metalsilver Armor”, your opponent CAN activate the effect of “The Thing in the Crater” because it Special Summons a monster from your HAND.</li>

<h4 id="mirage-of-nightmare">MIRAGE OF NIGHTMARE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If, after drawing during your opponent’s Standby Phase, your “Mirage of Nightmare” is destroyed before you have to discard, then you do not need to discard for its effect.</li>
  <li>You may activate “Mystical Space Typhoon” during your Draw Phase to destroy “Mirage of Nightmare” before you have to discard during your Standby Phase. If your Draw Phase was skipped for some reason, you can still activate “Mystical Space Typhoon” to destroy “Mirage of Nightmare” before activating the effect of “Mirage of Nightmare” that will force you to discard. (You can activate any number of effects during your own Standby Phase in any order you wish, as long as required effects are dealt with by the time you leave the Standby Phase and enter your Main Phase 1.)</li>
  <li>When the turn player controls “Mirage of Nightmare” and “Imperial Order”: If you draw for “Mirage of Nightmare” during your opponent’s Standby Phase, and then activate “Imperial Order” after that, during your Standby Phase you will have 2 mandatory effects: discarding for “Mirage of Nightmare” and paying 700 Life Points for “Imperial Order” or else destroying it. In this case, you choose which effect to resolve first, and you can choose to resolve “Mirage of Nightmare” first, even though its effect will be negated by “Imperial Order”. So you activate its effect, and do not discard. Then you can choose not to pay 700 Life Points to keep “Imperial Order”, and “Imperial Order” will be destroyed. Then you can enter Main Phase 1, and you did not have to discard for “Mirage of Nightmare” (because its effect was negated at the time you chose to resolve it).</li>
  <li>When the turn player controls “Imperial Order” and the opponent controls “Mirage of Nightmare”: If the opponent controls “Mirage of Nightmare” going into the turn player’s Standby Phase, and the turn player already controls a face-up “Imperial Order”, then there are 2 mandatory effects that must be resolved: the turn player must pay 700 Life Points or destroy “Imperial Order”, and the opponent must draw cards for “Mirage of Nightmare”. The turn player has priority to resolve an effect first. If the turn player passes, priority goes to the opponent. If the opponent also passes, then the turn player must resolve an effect, and must pay for “Imperial Order” or it is destroyed. If he does not pay, and “Imperial Order” is destroyed, then the opponent can draw for “Mirage of Nightmare”.</li>
  <li>The same procedure is used if both players control “Mirage of Nightmare”. Generally, the turn player will first discard for “Mirage of Nightmare”, then the opponent will draw for their “Mirage of Nightmare”.</li>
  <li>If you discard “Sinister Serpent” during your Standby Phase for the effect of “Mirage of Nightmare”, you may add “Sinister Serpent” back to your hand during that same Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple copies of “Mirage of Nightmare”, you don’t draw for more than 1 because you have 4 cards in your hand from using the effect of only 1 of them; nor do you have to discard for the second copy because you didn’t draw any cards using its effect. If you draw so that you have 4 cards using 1 “Mirage of Nightmare”, and some effect causes you to discard during that same Standby Phase, you may then activate the other “Mirage of Nightmare” to draw back up to 4; in this case you discard separately for each “Mirage of Nightmare” because you drew with both, and if 1 of them is destroyed you do not have to discard for its effect, only for the effect of the “Mirage of Nightmare” that was not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you have 4 or more cards in your hand during your opponent’s Standby Phase, do not draw, and do not discard during your next Standby Phase (the effect of “Mirage of Nightmare” is not applied).</li>
  <li>If your Standby Phase is skipped because of “Solomon’s Lawbook”, etc., do not discard for “Mirage of Nightmare”.</li>
  <li>Drawing for “Mirage of Nightmare” is considered 1 draw no matter how many cards are drawn, so you only gain 500 Life Points if you have “Solemn Wishes”.</li>
  <li>If you draw 3 cards for “Mirage of Nightmare”, but only have 2 cards in your hand during your next Standby Phase, discard your entire hand (2 cards)</li>
</ul>

  <li>If Mirage of Nightmare is destroyed before you have to discard, then you do not need to discard for Mirage of Nightmare’s effect.</li>
  <li>You may use Mystical Space Typhoon during the Draw Phase to destroy Mirage of Nightmare before you have to discard.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple copies of Mirage of Nightmare, you don’t draw for more than 1 because you have 4 cards in your hand from using the effect of only 1 of them; nor do you have to discard for the second copy because you didn’t draw any cards using its effect.</li>
  <li>If you draw so that you have 4 cards using 1 Mirage of Nightmare, and some effect causes you to discard during that same Standby Phase, you may activate the other Mirage of Nightmare to draw back up to 4; in this case you discard separately for each Mirage of Nightmare, and if 1 of them is destroyed you do not have to discard for its effect, only for the effect of the Mirage of Nightmare that was not destroyed.</li>
  <li>When both players have Mirage of Nightmare active, first the turn player discards for his/her Mirage of Nightmare, then the opponent draws for his/her Mirage of Nightmare. If you have 4 or more cards in your hand, do not draw, and do not discard down to 4 (Mirage of Nightmare’s effect is not applied).</li>
  <li>If the Standby Phase is skipped by Solomon’s Lawbook, etc., do not discard for Mirage of Nightmare’s effect.</li>
  <li>If you discard Sinister Serpent during your Standby Phase for Mirage of Nightmare’s effect, you may add Sinister Serpent back to your hand during that same Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>Drawing for Mirage of Nightmare is considered 1 draw no matter how many cards are drawn, so you only gain 500 Life Points if you have Solemn Wishes, etc.</li>
  <li>If you draw 3 cards for Mirage of Nightmare’s effect, but only have 2 cards in your hand during your next Standby Phase, discard your entire hand (2 cards).</li>
  <li>If you draw for Mirage of Nightmare, and then activate Imperial Order, so that Imperial Order is active during your Standby Phase, you do not have to discard for Mirage of Nightmare.</li>
  <li>If you have Mirage of Nightmare and Imperial Order, during your Standby Phase you can activate Mirage of Nightmare’s discard effect first (and NOT discard because Mirage of Nightmare’s effect is negated) and THEN choose not to pay for Imperial Order, so Imperial Order is destroyed; you then enter your Main Phase 1 without having to discard for Mirage of Nightmare.</li>
  <li>If Player A controls Mirage of Nightmare, and Player B controls Imperial Order, and it is Player B’s Standby Phase, Player B has priority and may choose to resolve an effect first. If Player B passes priority, then it shifts to Player A and Player A may choose to resolve an effect. If Player A declines priority, it shifts back to Player B and Player B MUST resolve an effect. So Player B must choose whether or not to pay for Imperial Order, and if Player B does not pay for Imperial Order and it is destroyed, Player A can draw cards for Mirage of Nightmare.</li>

<h4 id="mirror-force">MIRROR FORCE</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Mirror Force” is not a targeting effect, regardless of the number of monsters it destroys.</li>
  <li>Monsters turned face down or removed from the field in a chain with “Mirror Force” are not destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mirror-wall">MIRROR WALL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Mirror Wall” is already face-up on the field when a monster declares an attack, “Mirror Wall” reduces the ATK of the attacking monster by half when the attack is declared.</li>
  <li>If “Mirror Wall” is activated during an attack (including during the Damage Step), then it reduces the ATK of the attacking monster when “Mirror Wall” resolves. (Even though “Mirror Wall” normally reduces the attack by half when the attack is declared, it will still reduce the attack by half if you activate it after the attack is declared.)</li>
  <li>If “Mirror Wall” halves the ATK of a monster, it remains halved as long as “Mirror Wall” remains face-up on the field. If “Mirror Wall” is removed from the field, the ATK of the monsters is restored.</li>
  <li>If a monster attacks twice (over 2 turns, or if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” attacks twice in a row, etc.), its ATK is still only reduced by half once. So “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” will have 1500 ATK for both of its attacks, for example.</li>
  <li>If you have 2 copies of “Mirror Wall”, and a monster attacks, its ATK is one-quarter. So “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” would have 750 ATK, for example. If 1 of the “Mirror Wall” copies leaves play, then the ATK is increased to half (if both copies leave play, the ATK is restored to full.)</li>
  <li>You can activate “Mirror Wall” during the Damage Step before damage calculation.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Mirror Wall” does not target.</li>
  <li>“Reverse Trap” will have no effect on “Mirror Wall”.</li>
</ul>

  <li>“Mirror Wall” may be activated in the Damage Step.</li>

Then you can activate the effect of “Mobius the Frost Monarch”.</li>
  <li>If “Mobius the Frost Monarch” is Tribute Summoned by the effect of “Ultimate Offering” in the middle of a chain (and is not the last step of the chain to resolve), then you have missed the timing on his effect and you cannot activate his effect to destroy 2 Spell or Trap Cards.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Mokey Mokey King” that was Special Summoned by “Magical Scientist” is returned to the Fusion Deck, it has been removed from the field so its effect activates and you Special Summon as many “Mokey Mokey” as possible from your Graveyard.</li>
  <li>Missing the Timing: If “Mokey Mokey King” leaves the field in the middle of a chain (for example, if destroyed by “Ring of Destruction” chained to “Pot of Greed”, or Tributed for a Tribute Summon or for the effect of “Cannon Soldier”, etc.,), you miss the timing and you cannot Special Summon.

  <li>Your opponent can chain “Royal Oppression”’s effect to negate “Monster Gate”’s effect.</li>
  <li>Cards picked up that cannot be Normal Summoned are considered “sent to the Graveyard”, not “discarded”.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon “Dark Magician of Chaos” with “Monster Gate”, the effect of “Dark Magician of Chaos” activates, but it activates after “Monster Gate” has fully resolved and sent other picked up cards to the Graveyard, so you can use “Dark Magician of Chaos”’ effect to retrieve a Spell Card that was picked up and sent to the Graveyard by “Monster Gate” in the process of searching for the “Dark Magician of Chaos”.</li>

<ul>
  <li>If “Mystic Swordsman LV2” attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, that monster is destroyed by “Mystic Swordsman LV2”’s effect, not as a result of battle. So you cannot use its second effect to Special Summon “Mystic Swordsman LV4” during the End Phase.</li>

<h4 id="mystical-knight-of-jackal">MYSTICAL KNIGHT OF JACKAL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In order to activate the effect of “Mystical Knight of Jackal”, the monster that “Mystical Knight of Jackal” destroyed as a result of battle must be your opponent’s own monster, not one of your monsters that your opponent controls.</li>
  <li>“Mystical Knight of Jackal” sends a monster to the Graveyard as a result of battle, and THEN returns it to the top of the deck, so “Sangan” or “Witch of the Black Forest”, etc., will activate their effects.</li>
  <li>If “Banisher of the Light” is in play, the monster is removed from play and “Mystical Knight of Jackal” does not activate its effect so the monster does not return to the top of the Deck.</li>

  <li>“Mystical Knight of Jackal” does activate its effect even if “Necrovalley” is in play.</li>
  <li>When “Mystical Knight of Jackal” attacks “Mystic Tomato”, during the End Step both effects activate simultaneously once “Mystic Tomato” is sent to the Graveyard, so they form a chain. The turn player’s effect is Step 1 of a chain, and the opponent’s is Step 2; so “Mystic Tomato” resolves first, and a monster is Special Summoned and the Deck shuffled. Then the turn player chooses whether to place “Mystic Tomato” on top of the owner’s Deck with the effect of “Mystical Knight of Jackal”.</li>

  <li>Once “Narrow Pass” is activate, as long as it remains face-up on the field, Player A can Normal Summon or Set 2 up to 2 additional monsters, and Player B can Normal Summon or Set up to 2 additional monsters. It is helpful to place counters on “Narrow Pass” to keep track.</li>

  <li>If the effect of “Necrovalley” is negated by “Imperial Order”, then cards that require “Necrovalley” on the field, such as “Gravekeeper’s Assailant”, etc., can still apply their effects because “Necrovalley” is still on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Necrovalley” is active, neither player may activate “Book of Life”.</li>
  <li>If “Necrovalley” is active and you Special Summon the Spell Card “Gravekeeper’s Servant” with “Magical Hats”, its ATK and DEF will be 500.</li>

<h4 id="negate-attack">NEGATE ATTACK</h4>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Negate Attack” stop the entire Battle Phase or just the Damage Step?<br />
A: Negate Attack DOES stop the ENTIRE Battle Phase after it negates the opponent’s attack. In other words, you are <em>NOT</em> allowed to declare any more attacks, because the Battle Phase is over due to Negate Attack. Steve Okegawa, 01/02/2004</li>

  <li>“Neko Mane King”’s effect activates even if it is sent to the Graveyard while face-down on the field, or sent to the Graveyard from your Deck or hand.</li>
  <li>When “Neko Mane King” is sent to the Graveyard by the effect of “Delinquent Duo” or “Card Destruction”, “Neko Mane King”’s effect is activated after those cards completely resolve all of their effects.</li>

<p>GoatRulings.com Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Newdoria” and “Pyramid Turtle” crash or destroy each other in battle can “Newdoria” destroy the monster summoned off of “Pyramid Turtle”?<br />
A: No. “Newdoria” is a mandatory effect and “Pyramid Turtle” is an optional effect so “Newdoria” will be chain link 1 regardless of who turn player is. Newdoria must target at activation. So the target to be destroyed by “Newdoria” will need to be chosen before the effect of pyramid turtle activates.</li>

<h4 id="night-assailant">NIGHT ASSAILANT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Night Assailant” doesn’t have to be sent to the Graveyard by an effect, or by an effect controlled by your opponent; it just has to be sent to the Graveyard. “Night Assailant”’s effect activates when sent to the Graveyard as a cost for “Magic Jammer” or “Tribe-Infecting Virus”; “Night Assailant”’s effect activates after the current chain resolves.</li>
  <li>“Night Assailant”’s effect activates when sent to the Graveyard by “Morphing Jar” or “Card Destruction”.</li>
  <li>“Night Assailant”’s effect activates when sent to the Graveyard for a Ritual Summon.</li>
  <li>When “Night Assailant” is sent to the Graveyard by the effect of “Last Turn”, FIRST resolve “Last Turn”’s effect of sending all cards on the field and in the hands to the Graveyard, SECOND activate and resolve the effect of “Night Assailant”, and THIRD Special Summon a monster by the effect of “Last Turn”.</li>
  <li>You cannot select the “Night Assailant” that was itself sent to the Graveyard, so there is no infinite loop.</li>
  <li>When multiple “Night Assailants” are sent to the Graveyard at the same time because of “Graceful Charity”, etc., both can be returned to your hand because “Night Assailant” cannot select itself but CAN select a different “Night Assailant”, even one that was sent to the Graveyard at the same time.</li>
  <li>Both of “Night Assailant”’s effects target.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Night Assailant”’s second effect while “Necrovalley” is active.</li>
  <li>If your opponent has your “Night Assailant” in his hand (because of “Exchange”) and it’s sent to the Graveyard, you (the owner) get the effect.</li>
  <li>If you have “Forced Requisition” active (face-up) and 7 cards in your hand during the End Phase (and one of them is a “Night Assailant”), and there is another “Night Assailant” in your Graveyard, and you discard your “Night Assailant” because you have 7 cards, your opponent must discard because of “Forced Requisition”. Then you can activate the effect of “Night Assailant” to retrieve the other “Night Assailant”. Now you have 7 cards in your hand again so you can discard “Night Assailant”, and your opponent must discard again for “Forced Requisition”. You can continue doing this until your opponent loses all cards in their hand.</li>

<h4 id="nightmare-wheel">NIGHTMARE WHEEL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If you activate “Nightmare Wheel” during the Battle Step and target a monster that is attacking, the attack stops.</li>
  <li>“Nightmare Wheel” targets. You select the monster when “Nightmare Wheel” is activated.</li>
  <li>“Nightmare Wheel” is destroyed when the targeted monster is destroyed, returned to the hand, removed from play, send to the Graveyard, etc.</li>
  <li>“Nightmare Wheel” is NOT destroyed if the monster is flipped face-down. “Nightmare Wheel” continues to target the monster, inflict damage, and prevent the monster from attacking or changing battle position.</li>
  <li>If a face-down monster targeted by the effect of “Nightmare Wheel” is rearranged by the effect of “Wandering Mummy” or “Shifting Shadows”, the monster’s controller must honestly announce which monster is the target of “Nightmare Wheel”.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Nightmare Wheel” will be negated by “Royal Decree”, so you can attack or change the battle position of the monster. Also, if “Royal Decree” is active, and the monster is removed from the field, “Nightmare Wheel” remains on the field meaninglessly because its text that would destroy it is negated. If “Royal Decree” is later destroyed, the effects of “Nightmare Wheel” are not applied (such as the 500 damage) if there is no monster being targeted by “Nightmare Wheel”.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Nightmare Wheel” is still applied if the targeted monster changes sides.</li>

<h4 id="ninja-grandmaster-sasuke">NINJA GRANDMASTER SASUKE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”’s effect activates at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. So if “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” will not destroy it with his effect because it is not flipped face-up until after “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”’s effect would activate.</li>
  <li>A face-up Defense Position “Spirit Reaper” will be destroyed by the effect of “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”. “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”’s effect does not target. So if “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” attacks “Spirit Reaper”, “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”’s effect, not by “Spirit Reaper”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” attacks a face-up Defense Position “D.D. Warrior Lady”, “D.D. Warrior Lady” is destroyed by the effect of “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” and “D.D. Warrior Lady”’s effect is not activated.</li>
  <li>If “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” attacks a face-up Defense Position monster, and you flip it face-down during the Battle Step with “Book of Moon”, the monster is face-down at the start of the Damage Step so “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” will not destroy it with his effect.</li>
  <li>If “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke” attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, and “Ceasefire” is activated during the Battle Step, the monster is face-up at the start of the Damage Step so it will be destroyed by “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”’s effect.</li>

<ul>
  <li>“Ninjitsu Art of Transformation” does not target; you select the monster to Special Summon when you resolve its effect.</li>
  <li>If “The Legendary Ocean” is active, your WATER monsters in your hand are lowered by 1 level so if you Special Summon from your hand using “Ninjitsu Art of Transformation”, you can Summon at 1 level lower (effectively making it Level +4 if looking at the original Level).</li>

<h4 id="nitro-unit">NITRO UNIT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you equip “Nitro Unit” to a monster on your opponent’s side of the field, then you take control of that monster, “Nitro Unit” is destroyed because the monster is no longer on your opponent’s side of the field.</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your monster, and you target it with “Nitro Unit”, but your opponent chains “Remove Brainwashing”, “Nitro Unit” is destroyed because its target is no longer on your opponent’s side of the field when “Nitro Unit” resolves.</li>
  <li>When the monster equipped with “Nitro Unit” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, the effect of “Nitro Unit” can be chained to.</li>
  <li>The damage inflicted by “Nitro Unit” is based on the equipped monster’s original ATK (in the Graveyard).</li>

<h4 id="nobleman-of-crossout">NOBLEMAN OF CROSSOUT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the targeted monster is a Flip Effect Monster, it is not flipped face-up and its Flip Effect is not activated. Both players must reveal their Decks to each other to verify that all cards of the same name as the Flip Effect Monster are removed from play.</li>
  <li>The targeted monster, and any cards of the same name if the target was a Flip Effect Monster, are removed from play and never go to the Graveyard, so the effects of cards like “Sangan” will not activate.</li>
  <li>Cards of the same name in your hand or on the field are NOT removed from play.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If I remove a card, say with “Nobleman of Crossout”, must my opponent show me their Deck to prove it contains no remaining copies? What if the card is “Fiber Jar”?<br />
A: A game penalty would be in order should more than one “Fiber Jar” be in someone’s deck. Of course, this should have already been resolved by a deck check prior to the tournament. To answer your question more generally, however, “Nobleman of Crossout” would allow for an opponent to check your deck to ensure compliance to the resolution of the effect. bishop, 01/23/2004</li>
</ul>

<p>Other Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your opponent may indeed ask that you prove there are no more of that card in your deck. It is their right to do so. The ruling is in place in order to allow the opponent the opportunity to verify that you do not have a 2nd or 3rd copy… Unfortunately, the ruling opens the door, that the opponent gets a chance to look at your deck. Now, you do NOT give your deck to your opponent, but you may fan through it to verify that there is not another card of that name in it. The opponent may NOT take the time to stop and read card effects, look at other cards, or use this as a stalling technique themselves. This almost comes down to a courtesy that if you don’t look at mine, I won’t look at yours, or if you look at mine, I will look at yours. So this part of the ruling almost never comes up in play.

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>You can only chain “Null and Void” to an effect that draws cards and does nothing else. You can chain “Null and Void” to the activation of “Pot of Greed” or “Jar of Greed”. You can chain “Null and Void” to the activation of the effect of cards like “Airknight Parshath”.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Null and Void” to a Continuous Spell or Trap Card that causes drawing, such as “Mirage of Nightmare” or “Heart of the Underdog”.</li>
  <li>You cannot chain “Null and Void” to “Disturbance Strategy”, “Graceful Charity”, “Card Destruction”, “Morphing Jar”, “Mind Wipe”, “Dragged Down into the Grave”, or “Reload”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Null and Void” during the Damage Step, for example against the effects of “Airknight Parshath”, “Sasuke Samurai #3” or “Bistro Butcher”.</li>
  <li>The card(s) discarded by the effect of “Null and Void” are never treated as actually drawn, so they are considered sent from the Deck to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Null and Void” to “Reckless Greed”. Since you cannot draw by the effect of “Reckless Greed”, the effect of skipping 2 Draw Phases is NOT applied.</li>

  <li>You must take the 2000 points or more of Battle Damage from a single attack. If you take 1000 points of damage from one attack, and then 1200 points of damage from a second attack, the effect of this card will not activate.</li>

  <li>You can activate 2 copies of “Nutrient Z” and you will gain 8000 Life Points if you would take 2000 points or more of Battle Damage.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Kuriboh” in a chain to “Nutrient Z”’s effect. The effect of “Kuriboh” would reduce the Battle Damage to 0, and then the effect of “Nutrient Z” will no longer increase you Life Points. You must actually take the damage to gain the benefit of “Nutrient Z”’s effect.</li>

<h4 id="obnoxious-celtic-guard">OBNOXIOUS CELTIC GUARD</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Obnoxious Celtic Guard” and “Celtic Guardian” are considered 2 separate monsters so you can have 3 of each in your Deck.</li>
  <li>“Obnoxious Celtic Guard”’s effect looks at the ATK during Damage Calculation. So if he’s WIND and is attacked by “Insect Soldiers of the Sky”, their ATK is 2000 during Damage Calculation and “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” is not destroyed. Or if an 1800 monster attacks and you use “Rush Recklessly” to increase the ATK to 2500 during the Damage Step, “Obnoxious Celtic Guardian” is not destroyed.</li>
  <li>“Obnoxious Celtic Guard”’s effect looks at current ATK, not original ATK. So a monster with 1000 original ATK equipped with “Megamorph” to make it 2000 ATK will not destroy “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” as a result of battle.</li>
  <li>“Obnoxious Celtic Guard” isn’t destroyed by damage calculation but can be destroyed by monster effects like “Ryu Kokki”.</li>
  <li>If “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, or another monster that negates a card’s effect after it destroys it, “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” is not destroyed (so its effect is not negated).</li>
  <li>“Obnoxious Celtic Guard”’s effect works for a battle caused by “Last Turn”, so if it battles a monster with ATK 1900 or higher, neither is destroyed and the Duel is a draw.</li>

  <li>Damage is inflicted by the effect of “Ojama Trio” only when the Ojama Tokens are destroyed.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Can you chain “Ojama Trio” to the activation of a Spell or Trap Card that would Special Summon a monster in order to fill your opponents Monster Card Zone and prevent the Special Summon of the monster?<br />
A: If there is no open Monster Zone spaces during the resolution of the card that will Special Summon the monster, the monster is destroyed. In some cases like “Polymerization,” one of the monsters on your opponent’s side of the field may be used in the Fusion and would then leave an open space. Your opponent performing a Ritual Summon might offer a monster on their side of the field as a Tribute and would then have an open Monster Zone space to Special Summon the Ritual Monster. (They might even use your “Ojama Tokens” to help pay for the Ritual, since this Tribute would not be for a Tribute Summon) It can be situational. Curtis Schultz, 01/13/2004</li>

<h4 id="ordeal-of-a-traveler">ORDEAL OF A TRAVELER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Ordeal of a Traveler” each time your opponent attacks.</li>
  <li>You must show the card your opponent selects to your opponent.</li>
  <li>If your opponent calls it right, the attack resolves normally.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Ordeal of a Traveler”’s effect if you have no cards in your hand.</li>
  <li>When “Ordeal of a Traveler” &amp; “Fairy Box” are both active, “Fairy Box” (mandatory) is step 1 of the chain, and “Ordeal of a Traveler” (optional) is step 2.</li>
  <li>When you activate “Ordeal of a Traveler”’s effect as a chain to “Magic Cylinder”, since “Ordeal of a Traveler” resolves first, if your opponent guesses incorrectly then the attack does not resolve and the effect of “Magic Cylinder” disappears.

<h4 id="outstanding-dog-marron">OUTSTANDING DOG MARRON</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Outstanding Dog Marron” is sent to the Graveyard during a chain, its effect is activated after the current chain resolves (just like “Witch of the Black Forest”).</li>
  <li>When “Mystical Knight of Jackal” attacks “Outstanding Dog Marron” and destroys it, the effects are simultaneous. So “Mystical Knight of Jackal”’s effect is Step 1 of a chain and “Outstanding Dog Marron” is Step 2. “Outstanding Dog Marron” is returned to the Deck and “Mystical Knight of Jackal”’s effect disappears.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Can I activate “Painful Choice” and “Necrovalley” and still get all 5 pieces of Exodia?<br />
A: “Painful Choice” does not target a card or cards IN the Graveyard, so it is legal to activate while “Necrovalley” in on the field. “Necrovalley” does not negate the requirements for discarding to the Graveyard by cards like “Painful Choice”. bishop, 01/15/2004</li>

<h4 id="patrician-of-darkness">PATRICIAN OF DARKNESS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For this card’s effect, the chosen attack target must still be legal. You cannot force a monster to attack directly if it normally cannot, or force a monster to attack a monster on its own side of the field.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Patrician of Darkness” does not override the effects of “Marauding Captain”, “The Legendary Fisherman”, “Solar Flare Dragon”, etc. You cannot choose an attack target prevented by the effects of these cards. Examples: You cannot choose “The Legendary Fisherman” as an attack target if “Umi” is on the field. You cannot choose another Warrior-Type monster as an attack target when you control “Marauding Captain”.</li>
  <li>“Inaba White Rabbit” must still attack your Life Points directly since it is not able to attack other monsters. You cannot force it to with this card’s effect.</li>
  <li>If a monster has the optional effect of attacking directly, such as “Rainbow Flower”, you may choose a monster as an attack, or a direct attack.</li>
  <li>When you control “Patrician of Darkness” and a monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” you must chose the equipped monster as the attack target.</li>
  <li>Replays may occur as normal when this card is on the field. If, after the replay, “Patrician of Darkness” is still on the field and they choose to restart the attack, you will still choose the attack target with the effect of “Patrician of Darkness”.</li>
  <li>If you control “Patrician of Darkness” and “Lord of D.” you may still choose Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as attack targets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If there is more than one “Patrician of Darkness” on the field, does this create a non-attacking situation?<br />
A: No. Even if you have multiple “Patrician of Darkness” on your side of the field, the effect is not repeated. You will select a monster on your side of the field to be the monster your opponent will attack. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="penalty-game">PENALTY GAME!</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Penalty Game!” only requires your opponent to have 4 cards in hand when it is activated, not when it resolves. So your opponent can activate “Jar of Greed” to have 5 cards, or chain a Quick-Play Spell Card from his hand and have 3 cards, and “Penalty Game!” will still resolve.</li>
  <li>If you choose the first effect, neither player can activate a card that would require the opponent to draw during their next Draw Phase, such as “Jar of Greed” or “Disturbance Strategy”.</li>
  <li>If the second effect of “Penalty Game!” is chosen, the opponent can still activate the effects of cards that are already face-up on the field, such as “Skull Lair” or “The Dragon’s Bead”.</li>

<ul>
  <li>You may choose to return 0, 1, or 2 monsters to their owners’ hands.</li>
  <li>You may target Monster Tokens, and they will be taken off the field, instead of returning to the hand.</li>
  <li>Spirit Monsters can still be returned to their owners’ hands by the effect of “Penguin Soldier” even if “Spiritual Energy Settle Machine” is in play.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Penguin Soldier’s” effect DOES “specifically designate a target” for purposes of “Lord of D.,” etc.</li>
  <li>“Penguin Soldier” SOMETIMES “specifically designates 1 monster as a target” so for “Chaos Command Magician” or “Metalsilver Armor”, if “Penguin Soldier” is targeting ONE monster then it’s “specifically designating 1 monster as a target”. If Penguin Soldier targets TWO monsters then it does “specifically designate a target” but it does NOT “specifically designate 1 target”.</li>

<h4 id="peten-the-dark-clown">PETEN THE DARK CLOWN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing the Timing: “Peten the Dark Clown” is a “when… you can” optional Trigger Effect. This means that “Peten” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order to activate its effect.</li>
  <li>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for a Tribute Summon, the last thing that happened was that a monster was Summoned, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</li>
  <li>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for “Mystik Wok” or “Cannon Soldier”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</li>
  <li>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed in a chain and not as Chain Link 1, his effect does not activate. (Example: “Pot of Greed” is activated and “Ring of Destruction” is chained, targeting “Peten”.)</li>
  <li>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed by “Cyber Jar”, the last thing that happened was that monsters were Summoned to the field, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</li>
  <li>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded as a cost for “Tribe-Infecting Virus” or “Raigeki Break”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</li>
  <li>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded because of “Morphing Jar” or “Card Destruction”, the last thing that happened was that both players drew cards. So the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</li>
  <li>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, or by “Painful Choice”, the last thing that happened WAS that “Peten” was sent to the Graveyard, so his effect will activate.</li>

<h4 id="pharaohs-treasure">PHARAOH’S TREASURE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot select the “Pharaoh’s Treasure” you just drew and sent to the Graveyard as the card to place in your hand.</li>
  <li>You can select a face-up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” in your deck as 1 of the 5 cards for “Painful Choice”, but because “Painful Choice” is not a draw, the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will not be activated.</li>
  <li>If you take “Pharaoh’s Treasure” from your opponent’s hand with “Exchange” and activate it, the card goes in your Deck, not the original owner’s Deck. When you draw your opponent’s “Pharaoh’s Treasure” from your Deck after that, the controller gets the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” and retrieves a card from his Graveyard, but “Pharaoh’s Treasure” goes to the owner’s Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Convulsion of Nature” is active, place “Pharaoh’s Treasure” face-down so that it is the opposite direction of the rest of the cards.</li>
  <li>If a face-up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is in your deck and “Fiber Jar” is activated, shuffle the Deck with “Pharaoh’s Treasure” in it; if you draw the “Pharaoh’s Treasure” in your new 5-card hand, the effect is activated but because there are no cards in the Graveyard to retrieve, its effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you pick up a face-up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” because of “Cyber Jar”, this is not drawing so the effect is not activated; you may Set the “Pharaoh’s Treasure” you picked up and activate it again (placing it back into your Deck, etc.).</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Seven Tools of the Bandit” or “Solemn Judgment” when “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn.</li>
  <li>You can select a face-up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” from your Deck for “Different Dimension Capsule”; the “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is removed from play and kept face-down until the time elapses, at which point it is added to your hand, but it was not drawn so its effect does not activate.</li>
  <li>You can select a face-up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” from your deck with “Cat of Ill Omen”; if “Necrovalley” is not on the field, the “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is placed face-up on top of your Deck and will activate its effect when drawn.</li>
  <li>If you have no vacant Spell and Trap Zone spaces when you draw “Pharaoh’s Treasure”, you still get the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” because you don’t have to put it on the field.</li>
  <li>After “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is placed face-up in the Deck, “Jinzo” will not negate its effect when drawn.</li>
  <li>If “Drop Off” is used when a face-up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn, “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is discarded and its effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you draw a face-up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” with “Graceful Charity”, you miss the timing for the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” and the effect disappears. “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is simply added to your hand. In order to apply the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure”, the very last action must have been to draw. You CAN apply Pharaoh’s Treasure’s effect if it is drawn while face-up due to “Pot of Greed”, “Fiber Jar”, etc.</li>
  <li>If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn from your Deck (face-up) while “Banisher of the Light” is in play, “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is removed from play and its effect does not activate.</li>
  <li>You select the card in your Graveyard that you wish to add to your hand when “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn and activates it effect, so your opponent can chain AFTER you have announced which card you wish to retrieve.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn and a discard action occurs immediately following (such as through “Graceful Charity”), the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” disappears.</li>
  <li>If a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is revealed, but not drawn, the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” disappears.</li>
  <li>If “Drop Off” is chained to the effect of a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure,” the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will disappear.</li>
  <li>If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is face up in a player’s deck when the effect of “Fiber Jar” resolves, that “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will remain face up in that player’s deck. If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn as a result of “Fiber Jar’s” effect, “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will be sent to the Graveyard, but because there are no other cards, the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will disappear.</li>
  <li>An active “Jinzo” on the field will not prevent the resolution of a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure.”</li>

<h4 id="phoenix-wing-wind-blast">PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot target a face-up non-Continuous, non-Equip Spell or Trap Card. This is because they are already “considered to be destroyed” once they are activated (even though they are not sent to the Graveyard until the chain resolves). If you target a face-down Spell or Trap Card, the opponent can activate it as a chain. If it is not Continuous, it will not be returned to the top of the Deck. It will be placed in the Graveyard after the chain resolves, as normal.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Phoenix Wing Wind Blast” and target a face-up “Swords of Revealing Light” because it destroys itself by its own effect, instead of being destroyed when activated, like most Normal Spell Cards.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="physical-double">PHYSICAL DOUBLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot activate “Physical Double” during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Physical Double” and your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” to destroy his targeted monster, the effect of “Physical Double” disappears.</li>
  <li>You can target a Monster Token with “Physical Double” to create a Mirage Token copy of it.</li>
  <li>When the targeted monster’s Level, Attribute, etc. are changed after “Physical Double” resolves, the stats of the Mirage Token are not changed. When the targeted monster’s Level, Attribute, etc., are changed before “Physical Double” resolves, the changed stats are adopted by the Mirage Token.</li>
  <li>If a Field Spell Card was active before resolution of “Physical Double” that applied to the targeted monster, it applies to the original monster and to the Mirage Token. So if a Field Spell Card was increasing ATK by +500, the original would get +500 ATK and the Mirage Token would get an additional +500 ATK, for a +1000 ATK bonus total for the Mirage Token over the printed ATK of the original monster. Likewise, when “A Legendary Ocean” is active, and you activate “Physical Double” targeting a WATER monster, the Mirage Token’s Level Stars are 2 fewer than the printed Level Stars of the original targeted monster.</li>

<h4 id="pinch-hopper">PINCH HOPPER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing the Timing: Because the effect of “Pinch Hopper” effect is an optional “when… you can” Trigger Effect, “Pinch Hopper” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate its effect. So if you Tribute “Pinch Hopper” for a Tribute Summon, you cannot activate the effect of “Pinch Hopper” because the last thing to happen will be the Summoning of the Tribute monster. Also, if you Tribute “Pinch Hopper” for “Cannon Soldier”, the very last thing that happened will be the 500 points of damage inflicted to your opponent, so the effect of “Pinch Hopper” will not activate.</li>
  <li>If you offer “Pinch Hopper” as a Tribute to attack with “Insect Queen”, you can resolve “Pinch Hopper”’s effect after attack declaration.</li>
  <li>When your opponent controls your “Pinch Hopper” and “Pinch Hopper” is sent to the Graveyard, “Pinch Hopper”’s effect does not activate.</li>

<h4 id="pineapple-blast">PINEAPPLE BLAST</h4>

<ul>
  <li>When “Ring of Destruction” or “Call of the Haunted” is chained to “Pineapple Blast”, and the number of monsters on the field is changed, count the number of monsters at resolution of “Pineapple Blast”’s effect, not at activation.</li>
  <li>If, when “Pineapple Blast” resolves, you have no monsters, all of your opponent’s monsters are destroyed too.</li>
  <li>If you Summon a monster and want to activate “Pineapple Blast”, and your opponent wants to use “Trap Hole”, “Pineapple Blast” is Step 1 of the chain and “Trap Hole” is Step 2.</li>

<h4 id="pitch-black-power-stone">PITCH-BLACK POWER STONE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You place the 3 Spell Counters on “Pitch-Black Power Stone” even if “Royal Decree” is active, so if your opponent chains “Royal Decree” to your “Pitch-Black Power Stone”, or chains “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Jinzo”, you still get 3 Spell Counters on it.</li>
  <li>“Pitch-Black Power Stone”’s transfer effect targets.</li>
  <li>“Pitch-Black Power Stone” may itself receive additional Spell Counters from effects such as “Apprentice Magician”.</li>
  <li>You can use a Spell Counter from a card like “Breaker the Magical Warrior” and replace “Breaker the Magical Warrior”’s Spell Counter with “Pitch-Black Power Stone” on the same turn (and use “Breaker the Magical Warrior”’s effect again that same turn, if you wish).</li>
  <li>If you have multiple “Pitch-Black Power Stones”, each can transfer 1 of its Spell Counters per turn.</li>
  <li>If you have 1 Spell Counter left on “Pitch-Black Power Stone”, and your opponent activates “Mystical Space Typhoon”, and you chain the transferring effect of “Pitch-Black Power Stone” (a Spell Speed 2 effect), first the transfer effect resolves and the Spell Counter is moved, then “Pitch-Black Power Stone” is immediately destroyed before “Mystical Space Typhoon” resolves.</li>

<h4 id="pitch-black-warwolf">PITCH-BLACK WARWOLF</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of this monster makes the opponent of this monster’s current controller unable to activate Trap Cards during the Battle Phase. If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Change of Heart” during your turn, your opponent cannot activate Trap Cards during your Battle Phase, but you can.</li>
  <li>The effect of this monster makes your opponent unable to activate Set Trap Cards. However, your opponent can still activate the effects of face-up Trap Cards such as “Type Zero Magic Crusher”, “Ultimate Offering”, “Skull Lair”, “The Dragon’s Bead”, and “Astral Barrier”.</li>

<h4 id="poison-fangs">POISON FANGS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against the damage caused by “Poison Fangs”, since it is a Continuous Spell Card.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pole-position">POLE POSITION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The second effect of “Pole Position” does not begin a chain. When “Pole Position” is removed from the field, the effect is applied immediately and the monster is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Pole Position” is active, and your opponent controls “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” and “Skull Servant”, and you activate “Smashing Ground”, “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of “Smashing Ground” disappears.</li>
  <li>If you control “Dark Magician” and your opponent controls “Blue-Eyes White Dragon”, and you activate “Flint” targeting “Blue-Eyes White Dragon”, and your opponent chains “Pole Position”, then “Flint” is equipped meaninglessly to “Blue-Eyes White Dragon”. If “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” is destroyed, “Flint” can be equipped to “Dark Magician” meaninglessly if you choose (even if other monsters are on the field).</li>
  <li>If “Level Limit - Area B” and “Pole Position” are on the field, the highest ATK monster is unaffected by “Level Limit - Area B”. If it attacks, and during damage calculation “Mask of Weakness” is activated to reduce its ATK so that it is no longer the highest ATK monster on the field, the effect of “Level Limit - Area B” is applied. Also, the attack stops. Do not perform damage calculation.</li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot choose to Summon a monster, Set a monster, or Set or activate a Spell or Trap Card, or card effect, if it would cause an infinite loop. If you do this by mistake, just rewind the game to before the Summon/Set/activation occurred.</p>
  </li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #1: I have “Pole Position”, “Luminous Spark” (+500 to LIGHT), and “Gemini Elf” (1900 ATK / EARTH) face-up on the field. “Gemini Elf” is the monster on the field with the highest ATK, so it is unaffected by Spell Cards. If the opponent Summons “X-Head Cannon” (1800 ATK / LIGHT), “Luminous Spark” will raise the ATK of “X-Head Cannon” to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field, so it’s unaffected by Spell Cards, so it drops to 1800 ATK, then increases to 2300, then drops to 1800, etc. This would create an infinite loop. Therefore, the opponent cannot Summon “X-Head Cannon”.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #2: The opponent has “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” (3000 ATK) and “Pole Position” face-up on the field. I have “Gemini Elf” (1900 ATK), and an “Opticlops” (1800 ATK) equipped with “Axe of Despair”(+1000 ATK; 2800 total) face-up on the field, and a Set “Ring of Destruction”. If I activate “Ring of Destruction” to destroy “Blue-Eyes White Dragon”, then “Opticlops” will be the highest ATK monster on the field, and cause an infinite loop (it is the highest, it isn’t, it is, it isn’t, etc.). Therefore, I cannot target “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” with “Ring of Destruction”.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #3: The opponent has a face-down “Pole Position”. I have “Opticlops” (1800 ATK) and “Gemini Elf” (1900 ATK) face-up on the field. I activate “Axe of Despair” (+1000 ATK) and try to equip my “Opticlops” (1800 ATK). The opponent cannot chain “Pole Position”, since that would cause an infinite loop. “Pole Position” is an illegal activation. Put it back face-down.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #4: I have “Pole Position”, “Blade Knight” (1600 ATK / LIGHT), and “Luminous Spark” (+500 ATK to LIGHT) face-up on the field and 2 cards in my hand. The opponent has “Giant Orc” (2200 ATK / EARTH) face-up on the field, which is the highest-ATK monster on the field. If I Set 1 of the 2 cards in my hand, “Blade Knight” gains +400 ATK with its effect, becomes the highest-ATK monster, and because of “Luminous Spark” an infinite loop is created. So I am not allowed to Set a card.</li>
  <li>If an infinite loop is caused because of game mechanics and not by a player’s voluntary card play, “Pole Position” will be destroyed. When “Pole Position” is destroyed in this way, no monster on the field is destroyed by the effect of “Pole Position”.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #5: I have “Pole Position” and “Opticlops” (1800 ATK) face-up on the field. The opponent has a “Muka Muka” equipped with “Axe of Despair” face-up on the field with no cards in his hand. At the start of the opponent’s turn, he draws a card, making “Muka Muka”s ATK 1900. An infinite loop is created by something that could not be avoided, so “Pole Position” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #6: The opponent has “Blade Knight” (1600 ATK) equipped with “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” (+300 ATK; 1900 ATK total) and 2 cards in hand, along with “Marauding Captain” (1200 ATK). The turn player has “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Pole Position”, and “Giant Orc” (2200 ATK). The turn player attacks “Marauding Captain” with “Giant Orc”, inflicting 1000 points of damage. The opponent has to discard a card because of “Robbin’ Goblin” and an infinite loop is created because “Blade Knight” now fluctuates between 2300 and 2000 ATK (either above or below “Giant Orc”, making it the strongest monster on the field… or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #7: I have “Pole Position”, “Banner of Courage”, and “Opticlops” face-up on the field. The opponent has “Gemini Elf” face-up on the field. When I enter my Battle Phase, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2000 ATK. So “Pole Position” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE #8: I have “Pole Position”, “Gemini Elf” (1900 ATK / EARTH) and “Mystic Plasma Zone” (+500 ATK to DARK) face-up on the field, and an “Opticlops” (1800 ATK / DARK) in face-down Defense Position. The opponent attacks my face-down “Opticlops” with “Mokey Mokey”. When we flip “Opticlops” face-up in the Damage Step, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2300 ATK (either above or below “Gemini Elf”, making it the strongest monster on the field, or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.</li>

<h4 id="possessed-dark-soul">POSSESSED DARK SOUL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the opponent has more Level 3 or lower monsters on the field than you have empty Monster Card Zones after you Tribute this card (the Zone it occupied is now empty), you choose which ones to gain control of and the rest are destroyed. If you choose to destroy “Griggle” or “Ameba” in this manner, their effects do not activate since they never came to your side of the field.</li>
  <li>You cannot gain control of face-down monsters with this card’s effect, so the opponent may chain “Book of Moon” selecting a Level 3 or lower monster and they will keep control of it.</li>
  <li>You maintain control of the monsters until they are removed from the field.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If there are more level 3 or lower monsters on the opponent’s field than there is space on the player’s field when “Possessed Dark Soul” is Tributed for its effect, the excess monsters are destroyed.</li>
  <li>If a monster is reduced to Level 3 or lower by the effect of “Demotion,” and control is taken by the effect of “Possessed Dark Soul,” control will not return to the other player if “Demotion” becomes inactive.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pot-of-generosity">POT OF GENEROSITY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You return cards to the Deck when you resolve the effect (it’s not a cost).</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Pot of Generosity” if you have only 1 card in your hand besides “Pot of Generosity”.</li>
  <li>If an effect is chained to “Pot of Generosity” so that you only have 1 or 0 cards in your hand, the effect of “Pot of Generosity” disappears. Do not return cards to the Deck and do not shuffle.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Serial Spell” to “Pot of Generosity”, but you will have no hand so both effects will disappear.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="power-bond">POWER BOND</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” lasts as long as the Fusion Monster is face-up on the field. If it is flipped face-down or removed from the field, the ATK increase disappears.</li>
  <li>The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” is not a fixed number. It is a bonus equal to the original ATK. So if the original ATK changes, so does the bonus from “Power Bond”. For example, if you equip the Fusion Monster with “Megamorph” to change the original ATK, the bonus ATK for “Power Bond” adjusts so that the bonus is equal to the new original ATK. For example, if you Summon “Cyber End Dragon” and then equip it with “Megamorph” while your Life Points are lower, its original ATK will become 8000, so it gains an additional 8000 ATK from “Power Bond” for 16000 ATK total.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Barrel Behind the Door” against the damage from “Power Bond” because the damage happens much later than the activation of the “Power Bond” card.</li>
  <li>Even if the Fusion Monster is removed from the field or flipped face-down, you cannot negate the effect of “Power Bond” and the player will still take damage equal to the original ATK.</li>
  <li>The damage you take because of “Power Bond” is equal to the original ATK of the Fusion Monster at the time the monster is Special Summoned. If the Fusion Monster has its original ATK changed, this does not affect the damage inflicted by “Power Bond”.</li>
  <li>If you Fusion Summon “UFOroid Fighter” with 3000 ATK, and then later in the turn “Skill Drain” is activated, reducing its ATK to 0, you will still take 3000 points of damage during the End Phase. If you send “UFOroid Fighter” to the Graveyard so that its effect resets and its original ATK becomes zero, you still take damage equal to its original ATK at the time it was Special Summoned by “Power Bond”.</li>
  <li>You can prevent the damage from “Power Bond” with “Des Wombat”.</li>
  <li>If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active and “Power Bond” is used to Special Summon a Fusion Monster that has no effect, the Fusion Monster will not gain the ATK bonus from “Power Bond”, but the controller will still take damage for “Power Bond” (because the player is not a non-Effect Monster Card).</li>

<h4 id="precious-cards-from-beyond">PRECIOUS CARDS FROM BEYOND</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can’t use your “Precious Cards from Beyond” when your opponent offers 2 monsters as a Tribute, only when you do.</li>
  <li>“Precious Cards from Beyond” is only for a Tribute Summon or Set, not for a Ritual Summon or Special Summon like “Lava Golem”.</li>
  <li>If you Tribute Summon “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” for 1 Tribute using “Cost Down”, you can’t activate “Precious Cards from Beyond”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple “Precious Cards from Beyond”, you can activate each of their effects when you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 or more Tributes.</li>
  <li>If you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 monsters, and 1 of them was your opponent’s monster that you used with “Change of Heart” or “Soul Exchange”, you can activate “Precious Cards from Beyond”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Can the effect of “Precious Cards from Beyond” be used when summoning “Lava Golem” to the opponent’s side of the field?<br />
A: The effect of “Lava Golem” is not a Tribute Summon. It will not work with the effect of “Precious Cards from Beyond.” Tribute Summons are Normal Summons of 5+ Level Star monsters by offering Tributes. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</li>

<h4 id="premature-burial">PREMATURE BURIAL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot activate “Tailor of the Fickle” selecting “Premature Burial” as a target.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Fairy’s Hand Mirror” to make your opponent chose a different monster when they activate “Premature Burial”.</li>
  <li>If you activate this card and your opponent chains “Imperial Order” the effect of “Premature Burial” is negated and the Special Summon never occurs, but you still pay 800 Life Points. If “Imperial Order” is activated after “Premature Burial” is already on the field, the equipped monster is NOT destroyed and “Premature Burial” remains on the field meaninglessly. If “Premature Burial” is then destroyed while “Imperial Order” is still active, the monster remains on the field, but if the monster is destroyed, “Premature Burial” is also destroyed, since it is still equipped to that monster.</li>
  <li>If the equipped monster is flipped face-down “Premature Burial” is destroyed but the monster is not destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Netrep Rulings:</li>
  <li>If “Prickle Fairy” is turned to Insect-Type and there are only face up Insect-Type monsters on the player’s field, the opponent may not attack unless the attacker can inherently attack directly.</li>
  <li>If a face-down Insect Type is attacked while “Prickle Fairy” is face up and active on the field, Damage Calculation will proceed normally.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="primal-seed">PRIMAL SEED</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Primal Seed” can add cards to your hand that were removed from play face-up (“Dimensionhole”) or face-down (“Different Dimension Capsule”).</li>
  <li>You target the 2 removed cards when you activate “Primal Seed”.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have 2 or more cards removed from play, you cannot activate “Primal Seed”.</li>
  <li>A Fusion Monster selected with “Primal Seed” returns to the Fusion Deck.</li>
  <li>The required card only needs to be face-up on the field. It does not need to be a Monster Card, so if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” is equipped to “Relinquished”, you can activate “Primal Seed”.</li>

  <li>Monster cards chosen by the effect of “Prohibition” may not be Set.</li>
  <li>“Prohibition” will not prevent an instant win through the effect of “Exodia the Forbidden One.”</li>
  <li>If a “Prohibition” that declares “Jinzo” is negated by “Imperial Order”, “Jinzo” may be Summoned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Prohibition” has been activated and “Spirit Message ‘L’” is selected, will that prevent “Destiny Board” from completing the message?<br />
A: “Prohibition” would not stop the “Spirit Message ‘L’” from being placed onto the field by the effect of “Destiny Board.” Curtis Schultz, 04/07/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Does “Prohibition” only affect the field? (“Kuriboh”/”Thunder Dragon” never reach the field)<br />
A: “Prohibition” prevents the named card from being played. Activating the effect of “Thunder Dragon” or “Kuriboh” would be playing it. Curtis Schultz, 04/21/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If my opponent already has Set the card declared with “Prohibition,” can he activate the card?<br />
A: Yes they can. Prohibited cards that were Set on the field before “Prohibition” resolved can still be activated. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If my opponent plays “Monster Reborn” on the card declared with “Prohibition,” that is not considered “playing it” right?<br />
A: Right, but if the Monster Card is an Effect Monster Card, it will have no effect AND the monster would not be able to attack [or change its battle position]. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004</li>

<h4 id="protector-of-the-sanctuary">PROTECTOR OF THE SANCTUARY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your opponent cannot draw with “Airknight Parshath” while you control “Protector of the Sanctuary”.</li>
  <li>Most cards that would cause the opponent to draw outside of the Draw Phase, such as “Card Destruction”, cannot be activated, even by the controller of “Protector of the Sanctuary”. However, effects that are forcibly activated, like “Morphing Jar”, can be activated (but results may vary; see below).</li>
  <li>If “Protector of the Sanctuary” is on the field, then Flip Effects like “Morphing Jar” will still activate because they must activate when the monster is flipped (whether it was Flip Summoned, flipped by an attack, or flipped by “Book of Taiyou”, etc.).</li>
  <li>If “Morphing Jar”’s effect activates, then both players discard their hands, but if you control “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent does not draw a new hand.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate cards if they make your opponent draw, such as “Dragged Down Into the Grave”, “Card Destruction”, or “Disturbance Strategy”.</li>
  <li>“Protector of the Sanctuary” prevents your opponent from drawing with “Mirage of Nightmare”. However, your opponent can still activate “Mirage of Nightmare”, “Appropriate”, etc., even though he cannot use their effects at that time.</li>
  <li>If you control “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent cannot activate “Super Rejuvenation”, “Jar Robber”, “Monster Recovery”, or “Reload” outside of the Draw Phase.</li>
  <li>If you control “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent CAN activate “Reload”, “Jar of Greed”, “Reckless Greed”, etc., during the Draw Phase (either player’s).</li>
  <li>If you have “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent can activate cards like “Gamble” that are random as to whether he can draw, but he cannot draw even if he wins the coin toss.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Call of the Haunted” to a card effect that would make your opponent draw, and if you Special Summon “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent does not draw.</li>
  <li>If you have “Protector of the Sanctuary” and your “Bistro Butcher” inflicts damage to your opponent, your opponent doesn’t draw.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Heavy Slump” while you control a face-up “Protector of the Sanctuary”.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is chained to “Reckless Greed” to Special Summon “Protector of the Sanctuary”, you cannot draw for the effect of “Reckless Greed” because of the “Protector of the Sanctuary”, so you do not draw and you do not skip 2 Draw Phases.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is chained to “Disturbance Strategy” to Special Summon “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles it by the effect of “Disturbance Strategy”, but “Protector of the Sanctuary” prevents him from drawing.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is chained to “Upstart Goblin” to Special Summon “Protector of the Sanctuary”, you cannot draw 1 card and your opponent does not gain 1000 Life Points.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is chained to “Reload” to Special Summon “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent adds his hand to his Deck and shuffles it, but “Protector of the Sanctuary” prevents him from drawing.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is chained to “Graceful Charity” to Special Summon “Protector of the Sanctuary”, you cannot draw for the effect of “Graceful Charity” and you do not discard 2 cards.</li>
  <li>If “Call of the Haunted” is chained to “Mind Wipe” to Special Summon “Protector of the Sanctuary”, your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles, but cannot draw any cards.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If a player activates “Creature Swap”, gives their opponent “Pyramid Turtle”, and then destroys the “Pyramid Turtle” in battle, will the player be able to attack with the Special Summoned monster from “Pyramid Turtle’s” effect?<br />
A: Yes, in the situation presented the Zombie-Type monster Special Summoned by the effect of “Pyramid Turtle” may attack during that same Battle Phase. Curtis Schultz, 02/15/2004</li>

<p>GoatRulings.com Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Newdoria” and “Pyramid Turtle” crash or destroy each other in battle can “Newdoria” destroy the monster summoned off of “Pyramid Turtle”?<br />
A: No. “Newdoria” is a mandatory effect and “Pyramid Turtle” is an optional effect so “Newdoria” will be chain link 1 regardless of who turn player is. Newdoria must target at activation. So the target to be destroyed “Newdoria” will need to be chosen before the effect of pyramid turtle activates.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember that you cannot shuffle your Graveyard or change the order of cards in your Graveyard at any time.</li>
  <li>If a monster is named with “Question” that could not be Special Summoned, “Question”’s effect disappears and the monster is neither Special Summoned nor removed from play. So the effect of “Question” disappears if the bottom monster is incorrectly named and is “Helpoemer”, “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, etc.</li>
  <li>If you would Special Summon “Tyrant Dragon” from the Graveyard using “Question”, you must Tribute 1 Dragon and if you cannot you cannot Special Summon “Tyrant Dragon” and the effect of “Question” disappears</li>
  <li>Netrep Rulings:</li>
  <li>If a monster that has Special Summon requirements that was not properly Summoned is at the bottom of the Graveyard when “Question” is activated, that monster will not be Special Summoned.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The +1000 ATK lasts as long as “Raging Flame Sprite” remains face-up on the field. “Raging Flame Sprite” can continue to get +1000 ATK each time it successfully attacks directly (becoming ATK 1100, then ATK 2100, etc.).</li>
  <li>The effect of “Raging Flame Sprite” is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Raging Flame Sprite” is resolved after damage calculation and before Flip Effects are resolved (so the timing is the same as “Don Zaloog” and “Airknight Parshath”).</li>
  <li>If “Raging Flame Sprite” is equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce”, its ATK will increase by 1000 points after each successful attack (“Raging Flame Sprite” must still deal at least 1 point of damage with each attack for its effect to apply). So the second attack will be with +1000 ATK, and it will gain another +1000 ATK after the completion of the second attack.</li>

<ul>
  <li>If “Reckless Greed” is activated, causing you to skip your next 2 Draw phases, and you also must skip your Draw Phase due to another effect such as “Offerings to the Doomed”, the skipped Phases do not accumulate.

  <li>When an Attack Position “Reflect Bounder” is attacked, it is destroyed by its own effect even if the ATK of “Reflect Bounder” is lower than the ATK of the attacking monster.</li>
  <li>The damage inflicted by “Reflect Bounder”’s effect is not Battle Damage, so it cannot be reduced to 0 with “Waboku”.</li>
  <li>Effects such as “Metalmorph” and “Injection Fairy Lily” happen after “Reflect Bounder”’s effect, because “Reflect Bounder”’s effect happens before damage calculation.</li>
  <li>When your opponent attacks your Attack Position “Reflect Bounder”, your opponent can use “Barrel Behind the Door” against “Reflect Bounder”’s effect.</li>
  <li>When your opponent’s “White Magical Hat” with “Axe of Despair” attacks your “Reflect Bounder”, “Reflect Bounder” inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is performed, and “White Magical Hat”’s effect is activated.</li>
  <li>When “Reflect Bounder” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, “Reflect Bounder” inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is applied, “Reflect Bounder” is determined to be destroyed as a result of battle, “Dark Ruler Ha Des” negates “Reflect Bounder”’s effect, and “Reflect Bounder” does not destroy itself with its own effect, however it was still destroyed as a result of battle.</li>
  <li>“Reflect Bounder”’s effect does not target.</li>
  <li>If “Reflect Bounder” is attacked by “D.D. Warrior Lady”, and the effect of “Reflect Bounder” is activated, “Reflect Bounder” inflicts damage, damage calculation is performed, and “Reflect Bounder” destroys itself with its own effect and is sent to the Graveyard, so even if “D.D. Warrior Lady” activates her effect, “Reflect Bounder” is not removed from play because it is already in the Graveyard.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is in Face Down Attack position through the effect of “Darkness Approaches” will its effect activate when it is attacked?<br />
A: “Reflect Bounder’s” effect will activate after it is flipped face-up by the attack. “Reflect Bounder” is flipped face-up before damage calculation. That is why its effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If the opponent declares an attack on “Reflect Bounder” while in Defense Position and the player activates “Final Attack Orders”, will the effect of “Reflect Bounder” activate?<br />
A: The effect of “Reflect Bounder” would activate. This is because it is changed to Attack Position by the effect of “Final Attack Orders” after being flipped by the attack. This all occurs before damage calculation. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004</li>
  <li>Q: “Necrovalley” is face up on my side of the field. I attack my opponents face up “Reflect Bounder” with my “Gravekeeper’s Assailant”. I use “Gravekeeper’s Assailant’s” effect to change “Reflect Bounder” to defense mode. Now, do I take 2000 damage from “Reflect Bounder’s” effect, or since I changed it to defense mode, “Reflect Bounder” is destroyed by “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” taking no damage?<br />
A: The effect of “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” activates when you declare the attack. This is during the Battle Step. If you target “Reflect Bounder” with the “Gravekeeper’s Assailant’s” effect and it resolves properly, “Reflect Bounder” will be shifted to Defense Position. Then you would enter the Damage Step. Since “Reflect Bounder” is now in Defense Position, its effect will not activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/04/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is chosen to remain on the field for the effect of “Last Turn,” will it inflict damage to the other player?<br />
A: The turn player is the one who is attacking when “Last Turn” resolves. If the person that activated “Last Turn” controls a “Reflect Bounder,” the “Reflect Bounder’s” effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/15/2004</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="relinquished">RELINQUISHED</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Relinquished”’s effect to equip itself with a monster can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2 since it is a Ignition Effect.</li>
  <li>A monster equipped to “Relinquished” occupies a Spell &amp; Trap Zone of the controller of “Relinquished”. So if you already have 5 Spell &amp; Trap Cards on the field you cannot activate the effect of “Relinquished”. Any Equip Spell Cards equipped to the selected monster are destroyed. “Relinquished” gains the ATK and DEF of the monster equipped to it, but not the effects of an Effect Monster.</li>
  <li>The selected monster is treated as a Monster Card when it is sent to the Graveyard, so the effects of “Sangan” or “Witch of the Black Forest” would activate, but the effect of “Mystic Tomato” would not, since it was not destroyed as a result of battle.</li>
  <li>You can not voluntarily destroy a monster equipped to “Relinquished” but you can use “Mystical Space Typhoon” or “Emergency Provisions” to eliminate it.</li>
  <li>“Relinquished” will only inflict its effect damage to your opponent if “Relinquished” would be destroyed as a result of battle and the equipped Monster Card is destroyed instead. When this occurs you inflict damage to your opponent equal to the Battle Damage that the controller of “Relinquished” received; this is the ONLY time “Relinquished” will deal effect damage. (If “Relinquished”, equipped with a 1800 ATK monster, attack a 3000 DEF Defense Position monster, “Relinquished’s” controller takes 1200 damage but “Relinquished” does not inflict effect damage to the opponent.)</li>
  <li>You can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” against Trigger Effects like “Lava Golem”, “Giant Germ”, “Relinquished” (when it inflicts effect damage, since “Barrel Behind the Door” can be activated during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap Card), “Minar” (when discarded), “Parasite Paracide” (when it inflicts effect damage), “Bowganian”, “Mushroom Man #2”, “Reflect Bounder” (when it is attacked), “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” (when it attacks and destroys a Defense Position monster and sends it to the Graveyard), “Granadora” (when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard), “Balloon Lizard” (when destroyed), “KA-2 Des Scissors”, “Needle Burrower”, “Atomic Firefly”, “Elephant Statue of Disaster”, and “Ameba”.</li>
  <li>Your opponent cannot target your “Blindly Loyal Goblin” with the effect of “Relinquished” or “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”.</li>
  <li>While “Gorgon’s Eye” is active, if “Relinquished” equipped with a monster is in Defense Position, the effect of “Relinquished” is negated, it can no longer be equipped with a monster, and the Monster Card equipped to “Relinquished” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, etc., and you activate “Relinquished”’s effect on your next turn to equip the monster to “Relinquished”, and your opponent chains “Remove Brainwashing” to “Relinquished”’s effect, control of the monster returns to you before “Relinquished”’s effect resolves and, since you cannot use “Relinquished”’s effect on monsters on your side of the field, “Relinquished”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>Monsters equipped to “Relinquished” while “Skill Drain” is active are negated and destroyed because “Relinquished” no longer has an effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and “Relinquished”’s ATK and DEF are returned to normal.</li>
  <li>While the effect of “Timidity” is active, you cannot destroy a face-down Monster Card equipped to “Relinquished”.</li>
  <li>“Token Thanksgiving” will destroy a Monster Token equipped to “Relinquished”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Relinquished” may equip itself with one monster at a time per turn.</li>
  <li>“Relinquished’s” equipping effect is a targeting effect.</li>

<ul>
  <li>A face-down card equipped to “Relinquished”/”Thousand-Eyes Restrict” is a legal target for “Nobleman of Extermination.” Curtis Schultz, 03/09/2005</li>
  <li>A face-down card equipped to “Relinquished”/”Thousand-Eyes Restrict” will be returned to its owner’s hand by “Byser Shock’s” effect. Curtis Schultz, 03/09/2005</li>

<h4 id="reload">RELOAD</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you have your opponent’s card in your hand and activate “Reload”, your opponent’s card is shuffled to his/her Deck.</li>
  <li>Your opponent can activate “Appropriate” in response to your drawing with “Reload”’s effect.</li>

  <li>If “Reload” is chained to the activation of “Drop Off,” the effect of “Drop Off” disappears.</li>

<h4 id="remove-brainwashing">REMOVE BRAINWASHING</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Remove Brainwashing” is activated, monsters like “Lava Golem” &amp; “Parasite Paracide” will return to their owner’s side of the field, monsters revived with “Monster Reborn” return to their owner’s side of the field, monsters taken with “Exchange” and played normally return to their owner’s side of the field, etc.</li>
  <li>When “Remove Brainwashing” is already active on the field and a switching effect is activated, or “Remove Brainwashing” is chained to a switching effect and is thus active before the switching effect resolves, control switches due to the effect but then switches back to the original owner because of “Remove Brainwashing”. So for “Creature Swap”, control is changed but then control goes back to the original owners. This means that if you give control of “Griggle” or “Ameba” to your opponent, their effect IS activated even though “Griggle”/”Ameba” then returns to the original owner’s control afterwards.</li>
  <li>If “Monster Reborn” is activated and “Remove Brainwashing” is chained (or was already active on the field), the monster goes to the side of the field of the player who activated “Monster Reborn”, then switches back to the original owner immediately afterwards.</li>
  <li>If “Remove Brainwashing” is activated and a player already has 5 monsters on the field, the returning monsters are destroyed. If multiple monsters are returning to the owner due to “Remove Brainwashing”, and he does not have enough room for all of them, the player who controlled the monsters chooses the ones that are destroyed and the ones that return successfully.</li>
  <li>When “Snatch Steal” is active, the +1000 Life Points effect is applied even if “Remove Brainwashing” has returned control of the monster to the original owner.</li>
  <li>“Remove Brainwashing” has no effect on a Monster Card equipped to “Relinquished” or “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”, and the Monster Card remains where it is, because it is an Equip Spell Card.</li>
  <li>If “Remove Brainwashing” is destroyed, control does not revert again, so if I activate “Change of Heart” and my opponent chains “Remove Brainwashing”, control of the monster comes to me and then reverts to my opponent. Then, later in the turn, if “Remove Brainwashing” is destroyed with “Heavy Storm”, control does not revert back to me and remains with the original owner. (The same for “Creature Swap”, etc.)</li>
  <li>If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, etc., and you activate “Relinquished”’s effect on your next turn to equip the monster to “Relinquished”, and your opponent chains “Remove Brainwashing” to “Relinquished”’s effect, control of the monster returns to you before “Relinquished”’s effect resolves and, since you cannot use “Relinquished”’s effect on monsters on your side of the field, “Relinquished”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>Control of “Blindly Loyal Goblin” cannot change even because of “Remove Brainwashing”, so if “Blindly Loyal Goblin” is Summoned due to “Monster Reborn” or using “Exchange”, the original owner will not control “Blindly Loyal Goblin”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Player 1 has all 5 Monster Zones filled and Player 2 activates “Monster Reborn” on a Monster in Player 1s Graveyard. What happens to the selected Monster if “Remove Brainwashing” is either already active or activated after “Monster Reborn” is resolved? Since the Monster can’t fit back on its owners Field would it be destroyed, would nothing happen until there is an open slot or something completely different?<br />
A: The monster would be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 12/04/2003</li>

<h4 id="rescue-cat">RESCUE CAT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If one of the monsters Special Summoned by “Rescue Cat”’s effect is flipped face-down, or removed from play temporarily, the effect of “Rescue Cat” is reset and that monster is not destroyed during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your “Rescue Cat” and activates its effect, your opponent gets the effect and Special Summons Beast-Type monsters from his/her Deck.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Rescue Cat” even if there is only 1 or zero Level 3 or lower Beast-Type monsters in your Deck. However, in this case you cannot Special Summon any Beast-Type monsters for the effect of “Rescue Cat”, and your opponent gets to check your Deck to confirm.</li>

  <li>If “Banisher of the Light” is on the field, a monster that is destroyed will be removed from play and cannot return to your hand since it never went to the Graveyard.</li>

<h4 id="reversal-quiz">REVERSAL QUIZ</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="reverse-trap">REVERSE TRAP</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a card gives a monster +100 ATK, and “Reverse Trap” is activated, that monster now has -100 ATK instead. This card only affects increases and decreases of a defined value, such as +200 (which becomes -200) or -500 (which becomes +500). It does not change cards which “double”, “half”, or “reduce to 0” the ATK or DEF of a monster.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step. This card affects monsters, Spell Cards, and Trap Cards controlled by both players.</li>
  <li>Additional “Reverse Traps” activated in the same turn will have no effect. So “Reverse Trap” will change “Axe of Despair’”s effect of adding 1000 ATK to subtracting 1000 ATK. If a second “Reverse Trap” is activated, the equipped monster still has -1000 ATK.</li>

<h4 id="revival-jam">REVIVAL JAM</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The cost of 1000 Life Points is paid when “Revival Jam” is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle. If “Revival Jam” is removed from the Graveyard before your next Standby Phase by cards like “Disappear” you do not get your Life Points returned to you.</li>
  <li>If you pay 1000 Life Points when your “Revival Jam” is sent to the Graveyard, and then activate “Call of the Haunted” to return it to the field before your next Standby Phase, and it is again destroyed you must pay another 1000 Life Points if you want it to return during your next Standby Phase. Its condition was reset when it was taken out of the Graveyard by the effect of “Call of the Haunted”.</li>

<h4 id="ring-of-destruction">RING OF DESTRUCTION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot activate “Ring of Destruction” during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>“Ring of Destruction” inflicts damage based on the current (total) ATK value, NOT the original ATK.</li>
  <li>This card targets a monster.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Ring of Destruction” to “Magic Cylinder”, “Magic Cylinder”’s effect disappears because the monster is no longer there (so “Magic Cylinder” inflicts no damage).</li>
  <li>If a player Tributes “Witch of the Black Forest” for “Summoned Skull”, you can chain “Ring of Destruction” to the effect of “Witch of the Black Forest”, in order to destroy “Summoned Skull”. If this reduces the player’s Life Points to zero, then they cannot use “Witch of the Black Forest”’s effect (to retrieve a 5th Exodia piece, for example).</li>

<h4 id="rivalry-of-warlords">RIVALRY OF WARLORDS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Rivalry of Warlords” is activated, each player must send monsters to the Graveyard so that he controls only 1 Type of monster face-up. You don’t select or name a Type when “Rivalry of Warlords” is activated; instead, you make it so you have only 1 Type. If, after this, your monsters are destroyed so you have no monsters on the field, you are free to play any Type again, and that new Type becomes the Type that you must play. (So if you send monsters to the Graveyard so you control only Spellcaster-Types, and your Spellcaster-Type monsters are destroyed, you may play a Dragon-Type monster, but can then only play Dragon-Type monsters as long as you control 1 or more face-up Dragon-Type monsters. If all your monsters are again destroyed, you can again play whatever Type you want.)</li>
  <li>This also means that when “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, each player can control a different face-up Type than his opponent.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Rivalry of Warlords” when either or both player(s) does not have any face-up monsters on the field, in which case once a player does have a face-up monster that monster’s Type becomes that player’s Type for purposes of “Rivalry of Warlords” (as long as the monster remains face-up on that player’s side of the field).</li>
  <li>When “Rivalry of Warlords” is activated, it has no effect on monsters that are face-down at that time and does not flip those monsters face-up.</li>
  <li>While “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, you can still Set monsters face-down if they are a different Type than the Type you control. If your face-down monster of a different Type is attacked, then the monster is destroyed after damage calculation. If the destroyed monster of a different Type was a Flip Effect Monster, its Flip Effect is still activated, and then the destroyed monster is sent to the Graveyard. If your face-down monster of a different Type is flipped by “Swords of Revealing Light”, “Book of Taiyou”, etc., then it is destroyed as necessary.</li>
  <li>As long as “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, you cannot Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon an inappropriate Type face-up (including “Jinzo”), but you can Special Summon face-down with “The Shallow Grave”, “Morphing Jar #2”, etc.</li>
  <li>If you have only 1 monster on the field face-up, you may Tribute it for a monster that is a different Type.</li>
  <li>If you have 2 monsters on the field face-up of the same Type, you cannot Tribute 1 of them for another monster that is a different Type (even “Jinzo”) as you would then have 2 different Types.</li>
  <li>If “Cyber Jar” is activated while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, you can Special Summon different Types of monsters face-down without penalty, or Special Summon 1 Type face-up and all the others face-down. But if you Special Summon different Types of monsters face-up, you have to destroy monsters to make it 1 Type.</li>
  <li>When “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, and you change the Type of all of your monsters with “DNA Surgery” or “Parasite Paracide” or “D. Tribe”, you now only have 1 Type so you are OK and no monsters are destroyed, and you can also Summon, Flip Summon, and Special Summon additional monsters that do not have that printed Type on the card and they will be considered that Type and are not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Magical Hats” while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, the cards Special Summoned with “Magical Hats” are unaffected by “Rivalry of Warlords” because they have no Type.</li>
  <li>When “Rivalry of Warlords” is active you can activate “Dragonic Attack”, but if you have other face-up monsters that are not Dragon-Types then the targeted monster is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Rivalry of Warlords” is active and you take control of your opponent’s face-up monster with “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal”, and that monster is a different Type than your other face-up monster(s), your opponent’s monster is destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a face-down monster is turned face up and does not match the Type of the other monsters on the field while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, that monster is destroyed after Damage Calculation.</li>
  <li>If “Rivalry of Warlords” is activated in a chain with an effect that would Special Summon a monster of a differing Type, the Special Summoning effect disappears.</li>
  <li>Monsters may be Set or Special Summoned face-down, even if of a different Type while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active.</li>
  <li>If Machine is not the current type and a Tribute summon would not remove all monsters from that side of the field, “Jinzo” may not be summoned while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active.</li>

<h4 id="robbin-goblin">ROBBIN’ GOBLIN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have “Robbin’ Goblin” on the field and attack with “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer” or “The Bistro Butcher” both effects activate simultaneously. Since you control both effects you can choose the order that they go on a Chain, so you can have the opponent draw due to the effect of “The Bistro Butcher” and then discard for the effect of “Robbin’ Goblin”.</li>

  <li>You can use “Rope of Life” to Special Summon “Jinzo” and “Jinzo”’s ATK will increase by 800 points.</li>

<h4 id="roulette-barrel">ROULETTE BARREL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can only use “Roulette Barrel”’s effect once per turn.</li>
  <li>You have to roll a die twice, not once. You must roll the die twice in a row, not once in Main Phase 1 and once in Main Phase 2, etc.</li>
  <li>You CAN select a die roll result which doesn’t match the Level Stars of a face-up monster. But if the die roll you select does match a monster, you MUST destroy a face-up monster with the correct number of Level Stars.</li>
  <li>“Roulette Barrel” can destroy itself with its effect.</li>
  <li>You cannot destroy a monster with 7 or more stars with “Roulette Barrel”’s effect.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If “Dice Re-Roll’s” effect is used for the purpose of re-rolling for “Roulette Barrel,” both dice are re-rolled.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="royal-command">ROYAL COMMAND</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card can be chained to the activation of a Flip Effect from a Flip Summon to negate the Flip Effect. It cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so if a Flip Effect Monster is flipped face-up when attacked you cannot chain “Royal Command” to negate its Flip Effect.</li>
  <li>If “Royal Command” is active on the field both players may still Flip Summon monsters, but any Flip Effects are negated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="royal-decree">ROYAL DECREE</h4>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active on the field when “Jinzo” is summoned, and “Royal Decree” is later activated, “Royal Decree” will negate “Skill Drain”. Since “Skill Drain” is no longer negating “Jinzo’s” effect, “Jinzo” will negate both “Royal Decree” and “Skill Drain.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="royal-keeper">ROYAL KEEPER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Royal Keeper” is not a Flip Effect.</li>
  <li>When a face-down “Royal Keeper” is attacked and flipped face-up, its +300 ATK effect is applied AFTER damage calculation.</li>
  <li>When your opponent activates “Bottomless Trap Hole” against “Royal Keeper”, the +300 ATK effect of “Royal Keeper” resolves after “Bottomless Trap Hole”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="royal-oppression">ROYAL OPPRESSION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are basically 2 ways to Special Summon a monster. The first way is with a Spell Card like “Monster Reborn”, a Trap Card like “Call of the Haunted”, or an Effect Monster like “Magical Scientist”. The second way is built in to the monster, and Special Summons it without activating an effect, such as “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” or “Dark Necrofear”. “Royal Oppression” can negate both of these types of Special Summon. In the first case, you chain the activation of “Royal Oppression”’s effect to the activation of the Spell, Trap, or Monster Card’s effect, and negate the effect. In the second case, right before the monster is Special Summoned, you can activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” to negate the Special Summon (the same procedure that you use for “Horn of Heaven” or “Solemn Judgment”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Example 1: If “Marauding Captain” is Normal Summoned, its effect activates. You can chain to this effect by activating the effect of “Royal Oppression”. The effect of “Marauding Captain” is negated, no monster is Special Summoned, and the “Marauding Captain” is destroyed. (The monster your opponent intended to Special Summon with the effect of “Marauding Captain” remains in his hand.)</li>
  <li>Example 2: If “Cyber Jar” is Flip Summoned and its Flip Effect activates, you can activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” in a chain to the Flip Effect. The effect of “Cyber Jar” is negated, no monsters on the field are destroyed by its effect, no cards are picked up, no monsters are Special Summoned, and “Cyber Jar” is destroyed by the effect of “Royal Oppression”.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Example 3: If “Call of the Haunted” is activated, you can activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” in a chain. The effect of “Call of the Haunted” is negated, and a monster is not Special Summoned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The effects of face-up Trap Cards cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so this card’s effect cannot negate the Special Summoning of a monster by the effect of “Mystic Tomato” or a “Cyber Jar” flipped face-up by an attack.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” as a chain to “Monster Gate”. No cards will be picked up, and no monster will be Special Summoned (The opponent still must have Tributed a monster as a cost).</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” to negate an effect that Summons 1 monster, or Summons multiple monsters (like “Cyber Jar”, “The Shallow Grave”, or “Valkyrion the Magna Warrior”).</li>
  <li>If “Royal Oppression” is face-up on the field, and “Monster Reborn” is activated to Special Summon “Jinzo”, you can activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” in a chain to negate the Special Summon because “Jinzo” is not on the field until the chain resolves.</li>
  <li>If you have “Royal Oppression” face-up on your side of the field, and your opponent attempts to Special Summon “Dark Necrofear”, and you activate the effect of your “Royal Oppression”, then “Dark Necrofear” will activate its effect in the Graveyard and return to the field as an Equip Spell Card. But if your opponent had “Royal Oppression” face-up on his side of the field, and you activate the effect of your opponent’s “Royal Oppression” to negate the Special Summon of your opponent’s “Dark Necrofear”, then “Dark Necrofear” does not activate its effect in the Graveyard, because it was destroyed by an effect controlled by its owner, not by its owner’s opponent (even though the owner did not activate the effect, he still controls the “Royal Oppression” card).</li>
  <li>When “Vampire Lord” is Special Summoned by its effect, you can activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” to negate the Special Summon and destroy “Vampire Lord”. If your “Vampire Lord” is destroyed in this way by the effect of a “Royal Oppression” card controlled by your opponent, then “Vampire Lord” was destroyed by a card controlled by your opponent, and is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>When “Insect Queen” destroys your opponent’s monster, an “Insect Monster Token” is Special Summoned during the End Phase, and the effect of “Royal Oppression” can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy “Insect Queen”.</li>
  <li>When “Jam Breeding Machine” activates its effect to Special Summon a “Slime Token” in the Standby Phase, and the effect of “Royal Oppression” can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy “Jam Breeding Machine”.</li>
  <li>If the effect of “Royal Oppression” is activated, and “Mystical Space Typhoon” or “Dust Tornado” is chained to destroy “Royal Oppression”, then the effect of “Royal Oppression” disappears because it is a Continuous Trap Card, and the Special Summon will not be negated.</li>
  <li>Remember that “Royal Oppression” follows the rules of all Continuous Trap Cards. In order to chain the effect of “Royal Oppression” to a card effect, “Royal Oppression” must have already been face-up on the field. For example, if “Monster Reborn” is activated, you cannot flip “Royal Oppression” face-up and activate the effect of “Royal Oppression” in the same chain.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="royal-tribute">ROYAL TRIBUTE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both players must show their hands to the opponent when “Royal Tribute” resolves.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Ryu Kokki” battles with “Dark Magician of Chaos”, “Ryu Kokki” is destroyed and removed from play by “Dark Magician of Chaos”’ effect, and “Dark Magician of Chaos” is removed from play because it is destroyed by “Ryu Kokki”’s effect and removed by its own effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ryu-senshi">RYU SENSHI</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card’s effect that negates Spell Cards that target it is not optional.</li>
  <li>You can Special Summon this card from the Graveyard with “Monster Reborn” because its effect that negates Spell Cards is not active while it is in the Graveyard (but only if was properly Fusion Summoned originally).</li>
  <li>A Spell Card that targets this card may be activated, but it will be negated and destroyed.</li>
  <li>The effect of this card will not negate “Creature Swap”, “Fissure”, “Smashing Ground”, “Dark Hole”, “Raigeki”, or similar cards that do not target.</li>
  <li>If you try to equip “Fusion Sword Murasame Blade” to this monster, it will be negated and destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="sacred-phoenix-of-nephthys">SACRED PHOENIX OF NEPHTHYS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its own effect. Because this effect activates in the Graveyard, and is being negated while “Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys” is in the Graveyard, “Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys” is never Special Summoned (so the card is never moved from the Graveyard) and is never destroyed. Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.</li>
  <li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned with “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”, and that card is destroyed and destroys “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” with its effect, you Special Summon “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.</li>
  <li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while in your hand or Deck by a card effect, you still activate its effect during your next Standby Phase to Special Summon it from the Graveyard. (For example, if an effect like “Star Boy” is active, and “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” is activated to destroy other copies of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” in the hand and Deck, those copies will be Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that Special Summons it from the Graveyard is still activated, because it is activated in the Graveyard. However, the effect that destroys Spell and Trap Cards on the field is negated because it activates on the field (so “Skill Drain” and other Spell and Trap Cards on the field are not destroyed in this case).</li>
  <li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and the Summon is negated by “Horn of Heaven”, it is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys”, and it is destroyed by a card effect, because the effect activates in the Graveyard, it is the owner that gets the effect and Special Summons “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during their Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed during your Draw Phase, you can Special Summon it during the Standby Phase of that same turn.</li>
  <li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed and removed from play, such as with “Bottomless Trap Hole”, it is not Special Summoned from out of play during the Standby Phase, because this effect activates in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, and your opponent takes control of your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” while controlling monsters that are not Winged Beast-Type, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is not considered destroyed by the effect of “Rivalry of Warlords”, but rather by a condition that made it impossible for it to exist on that side of the field. So it is not Special Summoned by its own effect during the Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while it is not a Monster Card, such as when it is equipped to “Relinquished” or “Sword Hunter”, its effect does not activate and it is not Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>You can chain to the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that destroys all Spell and Trap Cards.</li>
  <li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its effect during the Standby Phase, and “Card of Safe Return” is on the field, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Step 1 of the chain and “Card of Safe Return” is Step 2, so “Card of Safe Return” resolves first and you draw a card before “Card of Safe Return” is destroyed.</li>

  <li>If you control your opponent’s “Sangan” and it is destroyed, your opponent gets the effect since it activates in his/her Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can chain to “Sangan”’s effect.</li>

<h4 id="sasuke-samurai">SASUKE SAMURAI</h4>

<p>Individual Card Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Sasuke Samurai” attacks a face-down monster, apply its effect after entering the Damage Step, but before flipping up the face-down monster. The monster is not flipped. Flip Effects are not activated. Monsters like “Kisetai” and “Giant Axe Mummy” do not activate their effects.</li>
  <li>If “Sasuke Samurai” attacks a face-down monster, there is no damage calculation. “Sasuke Samurai” destroys the monster before damage calculation is reached.</li>
  <li>If “Sasuke Samurai” destroys a face-down monster using its effect, the face-down monster is NOT “destroyed as a result of battle”, it is destroyed by “Sasuke Samurai”’s effect. So “Mystic Tomato”, “Helpoemer”, etc. will not activate their effects. However, monsters like “Sangan” will still activate their effects.</li>
  <li>If “Sasuke Samurai” attacks a face-down monster, and “Ceasefire” is activated during the Battle Step to flip it face-up, “Sasuke Samurai” does not destroy it with its effect and damage calculation is applied normally. The monster must be face-down at the beginning of the Damage Step in order for “Sasuke Samurai” to activate its effect.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="sasuke-samurai-4">SASUKE SAMURAI #4</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You activate the effect of “Sasuke Samurai #4” at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. A monster destroyed by the effect of “Sasuke Samurai #4” is not destroyed as a result of battle. There is no damage calculation. It is not flipped face-up. Any Flip Effects it has are not activated.</li>
  <li>If “Sasuke Samurai #4” attacks a face-up Attack Position “Reflect Bounder”, the effect of “Sasuke Samurai #4” is resolved before the effect of “Reflect Bounder”.</li>

  <li>If the effect of “Royal Oppression” is chained to your “Scapegoat” your Sheep Tokens will not be Special Summoned and you still cannot perform any Summons that turn.</li>
  <li>If you have already Summoned a monster, including a Special Summon caused by the effect of your opponent’s “Cyber Jar” you cannot activate “Scapegoat”.</li>
  <li>You can Set a monster in the same turn you activate “Scapegoat”.</li>
  <li>If you control 2 monsters and your opponent activates “Change of Heart” to gain control of one and you later activate “Scapegoat” your monster will be destroyed during the End Phase if all 5 of your Monster Card Zones are still occupied.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Monster Reborn” and your opponent chains “Imperial Order” you can chain “Scapegoat” and “Royal Decree” but only “Scapegoat” will resolve since “Scapegoat” will prevent any Special Summons, and therefore “Monster Reborn” cannot resolve.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

  <li>If you switch the target of this card with “Collected Power” or “Tailor of the Fickle” you do not select a new Attribute.

<ul>
  <li>The effect of this card only applies when you perform a coin toss, not when your opponent performs a coin toss.</li>

<ul>
  <li>If you activate “Secret Barrel” and your opponent activates something as a chain, the chained card is included in the number (so if your opponent’s only card on the field or in his hand is “Mystical Space Typhoon”, and he chains “Mystical Space Typhoon” to “Secret Barrel”, he still takes 200 damage).</li>
  <li>Monster Tokens are counted for “Secret Barrel”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="secret-pass-to-the-treasures">SECRET PASS TO THE TREASURES</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no way to have a monster with an ATK above 1000 attack directly using the effect of “Secret Pass to the Treasures”. When you target a monster with “Secret Pass to the Treasures”, and the monster’s ATK is increased above 1000 afterwards, the monster cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly.</li>
  <li>If the monster attacks your opponent’s Life Points directly, you cannot use an effect such as “Rush Recklessly” to increase its ATK above 1000 during the attack. If a monster attacks directly using the effect of “Secret Pass to the Treasures”, “automatic” increases will not apply (“Super Robolady”, etc.). If you use “Secret Pass to the Treasures” on “Injection Fairy Lily”, and attack directly, you cannot activate the effect of “Injection Fairy Lily”.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Secret Pass to the Treasures” during Main Phase 2 or on the very first turn.</li>
  <li>This card targets a monster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<h4 id="senri-eye">SENRI EYE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot use “Senri Eye”’s effect more than once during the same Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>You can use the effect of “Senri Eye” if the top card on the Deck is face-up (due to “Convulsion of Nature” or “Parasite Paracide”), and in that case you don’t hide the card from your opponent.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="serial-spell">SERIAL SPELL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Serial Spell” must be chained to the activation of your Normal Spell Card. Nothing can be chained in-between by yourself or your opponent. If your opponent chains to your Normal Spell Card, you cannot chain “Serial Spell” to that Normal Spell Card. Because of this, it is impossible to chain 2 copies of “Serial Spell” to the same Normal Spell Card.</li>
  <li>“Serial Spell” does not target a card.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Serial Spell” to a Normal Spell Card that targets a card(s) you can select a different target(s) for the “Serial Spell” copy of the Normal Spell Card.</li>
  <li>Discarding your hand is a cost to activate “Serial Spell”. You cannot activate “Serial Spell” if it is the only card in your hand, or if it is Set and you have no cards in your hand.</li>
  <li>“Serial Spell” only copies the effects of your Normal Spell Card, not any costs of that Spell Card. So if you chain “Serial Spell” to “Delinquent Duo” you do not pay an additional 1000 Life Points.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Monster Reborn”, and chain “Serial Spell”, discarding your entire hand, you can select and revive one of the monsters you discarded for the cost of “Serial Spell” to be the monster that “Serial Spell” Special Summons to the field. (For example, if you target “Dark Magician” with “Monster Reborn”, then chain “Serial Spell” and discard “Buster Blader”, you can use “Serial Spell” to Special Summon the “Buster Blader” you discarded to activate “Serial Spell”.)</li>
  <li>You cannot level up “Horus the Black Flame Dragon” from 4 to 8 with just “Level Up!” and “Serial Spell”. Because you would send “LV4” to the Graveyard for “Level Up!”, but even if you copy it with “Serial Spell”, the first “Level Up!” hasn’t resolved, so “LV6” isn’t on the field to send to the Graveyard as a cost for the copy of “Level Up!” If you have “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4” and “Armed Dragon LV3” on the field, and send one of them to the Graveyard with “Level Up!”, you cannot use “Serial Spell” to Level Up the other monster, since there was no monster sent to the Graveyard as a cost for “Serial Spell”, and “Serial Spell” would have no point of reference to resolve its effect.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Serial Spell” to “Swords of Revealing Light” it will copy the effect of flipping all monsters face-up, but it will not remain on the field and prevent the opponent from attacking. This is because it is a Quick-Play Spell Card and is sent to the Graveyard after the chain resolves.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Serial Spell” to “Different Dimension Capsule” it will copy the effect and remove 1 card you select in your Deck from play, face-down. But because “Serial Spell” does not remain on the field, the selected card remains removed from play face-down and is not placed in your hand.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Serial Spell” to copy the effect of a Normal Spell Card, even if it is “Raigeki” or “Soul Exchange” and copying the effect serves no real purpose.</li>
  <li>If you have 2 monsters in your Graveyard, and your opponent only has 1 monster in their Graveyard, you can activate “The Shallow Grave” and chain “Serial Spell”, even though you would not normally be able to activate a second “The Shallow Grave” because your monster would no longer have any monsters in the Graveyard. As a result, you will Special Summon 2 monsters and your opponent will only Special Summon 1 monster.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Serial Spell” to “Bait Doll”, the entire effect of “Bait Doll” is applied and “Serial Spell” is also shuffled back into your Deck.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Serial Spell” to “Dragged Down into the Grave”, the player who activated “Serial Spell” has no cards in hand, so the effect of “Dragged Down into the Grave” is impossible to resolve, and the effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Serial Spell” to “Metamorphosis”, there is no effect because you did not Tribute a monster for a cost, so “Serial Spell” has no point of reference and cannot resolve.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Serial Spell” to “Monster Gate” resolve the effect of “Monster Gate” twice (once for “Serial Spell” and once for “Monster Gate”) even though you only pay the cost once (for “Monster Gate”).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="serpentine-princess">SERPENTINE PRINCESS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “Serpentine Princess” is returned to the Deck by an effect occurring in a chain, the effect of “Serpentine Princess” starts a new Chain after the current Chain resolves completely.</li>
  <li>If the effect of “Fiber Jar” places “Serpentine Princess” from the field into your Deck, the effect of “Serpentine Princess” is activated and will be applied after the effect of “Fiber Jar” has finished resolving.</li>

<h4 id="shadowslayer">SHADOWSLAYER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For “Shadowslayer” (unlike cards like “Black Tyranno” and “Drillago”), only the Monster Card Zones are looked at. If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position, then “Shadowslayer” can attack directly even if your opponent has Spell and Trap Cards on the field.</li>
  <li>If “Shadowslayer” attacks a face-up Attack Position monster, and the opponent activates “Book of Moon” so that his only monster on the field is now in Defense Position, a replay occurs, because “Shadowslayer” is now able to attack directly.</li>
  <li>If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position but one of them is equipped with “Ring of Magnetism”, “Shadowslayer” cannot attack directly and must attack that monster if it attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shadow-spell">SHADOW SPELL</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This card only switches the original ATK and DEF. All modifiers are then applied (or re-applied, as appropriate) to the new ATK and DEF.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shiens-spy">SHIEN’S SPY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you use “Shien’s Spy” on “Silent Swordsman LV5”, it returns to your control during the End Phase as normal.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Book of Moon” to “Shien’s Spy” to flip the target face-down, the monster still switches to the opponent and returns in the End Phase as normal.</li>
  <li>If a monster switches sides because of “Shien’s Spy” and is then flipped face-down, it still returns in the End Phase as normal.</li>
  <li>When a monster returns to the controller during the End Phase for the effect of “Shien’s Spy”, this is not an effect that can be chained to.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shifting-shadows">SHIFTING SHADOWS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have only 1 face-down Defense Position monster you cannot activate the effect of “Shifting Shadows”.</li>
  <li>If you control a monster that is targeted by your opponent’s “Nightmare Wheel”, and you flip it face-down with “Book of Moon”, and control at least 1 other face-down Defense Position monster, you can activate the effect of “Shifting Shadows”. However, afterwards you must tell your opponent which monster is targeted by “Nightmare Wheel”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shinato-king-of-a-higher-plane">SHINATO, KING OF A HIGHER PLANE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When your “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” destroys “Gradius’ Option” or “Maju Garzett”, your opponent takes no damage from “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” is destroyed before monsters are sent to the Graveyard, for example if removed from play by “D.D. Warrior Lady”, his effect does not activate. But if “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” attacks “Yomi Ship”, “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” inflicts the damage from his effect even though he will be destroyed by “Yomi Ship”’s effect after “Yomi Ship” is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” destroys a Defense Position monster, your opponent can activate “Barrel Behind the Door” as a chain to “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane”’s effect.</li>
  <li>When your “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” is equipped with “Fairy Meteor Crush” and destroys your opponent’s Defense Position monster, first, during damage calculation, “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane” inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent’s Life Points because of “Fairy Meteor Crush”, and then, when the Defense Position monster is sent to the Graveyard, “Shinato, King of a Higher Plane”’s effect inflicts damage equal to the original ATK of the destroyed monster.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shining-angel">SHINING ANGEL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you attack with your “Shining Angel” and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by “Shining Angel” before entering Main Phase 2.</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your “Shining Angel” and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of “Shining Angel” NOT your opponent.</li>
  <li>Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, “Torrential Tribute”, etc. cannot be used.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shooting-star-bow---ceal">SHOOTING STAR BOW - CEAL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” decreases the current ATK. So if “Injection Fairy Lily” is equipped with “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” and activates her effect, her ATK is 2400 ((400 - 1000) + 3000 = 2400).</li>
  <li>If a monster equipped with “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” declares a direct attack, and “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” is removed from the monster during the Battle Step with “Mystical Space Typhoon” or “Tailor of the Fickle”, the monster is no longer capable of attacking directly and a replay occurs.</li>
  <li>“Tyrant Dragon” must attack a monster in order to gain its second attack, so if it is equipped with “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” and attacks directly, it cannot get a second attack. But “Tyrant Dragon” equipped with “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” can attack a monster, and then attack directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Would equipping “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” on a fusion summoned with Magical Scientist allow it to attack directly? A: A monster that is Special Summoned via “Magical Scientist’s” effect… cannot attack the opponent directly. Even equipping the Fusion monster with “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” won’t change that condition. Steve Okegawa, 12/18/2003</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="silent-swordsman-lv3">SILENT SWORDSMAN LV3</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Silent Swordsman LV3” will negate the effects of your opponent’s Spell Cards that target it, whether that Spell Card targets just “Silent Swordsman LV3” (such as “Soul Exchange”) or multiple monsters (“Different Dimension Gate”).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="silent-swordsman-lv5">SILENT SWORDSMAN LV5</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Just like “The Legendary Fisherman” and other monsters that are unaffected by Spell Cards, “Silent Swordsman LV5” can attack normally if your opponent has “Swords of Revealing Light” on the field, and its controller is unaffected by effects like “Toll” and “Gravekeeper’s Servant” when “Silent Swordsman LV5” attacks.</li>
  <li>If you control “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” and “Silent Swordsman LV5”, and your opponent activates “Fissure”, the monster with the lowest ATK is “Silent Swordsman LV5”, but it is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of “Fissure” disappears.</li>
  <li>“Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected by Spell Cards your opponent controls, including those in your opponent’s hand due to “Exchange” or “Graverobber”.</li>
  <li>You can Special Summon “Silent Swordsman LV5” with “Autonomous Action Unit”. If “Autonomous Action Unit” is removed from the field, “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected and remains on the field.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sinister-serpent">SINISTER SERPENT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of this card is optional; you do not have to return it to your hand.</li>
  <li>The effect of this card activates no matter how it is sent to the Graveyard. It can be destroyed, Tributed, discarded from the hand, or sent straight from the Deck to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If your “Sinister Serpent” is on the field and is destroyed during your Standby Phase, you may return it to your hand during that same Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Sinister Serpent” is destroyed as a result of battle with “Dark Ruler Ha Des” or “Dark Balter the Terrible” you cannot activate its effect and return it to your hand during your next Standby Phase, or any subsequent Standby Phase.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate the effect of “Sinister Serpent” if “The End of Anubis” is on the field.</li>
  <li>“Necrovalley” does not negate the effect of “Sinister Serpent”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="skill-drain">SKILL DRAIN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.</li>
  <li>“Skill Drain” negates the effects of face-up Effect Monsters on the field, but does not negate effects that activate in the Graveyard, such as “Witch of the Black Forest”, “Sangan”, “Mystic Tomato”, “Giant Rat”, “Exiled Force”, “Sinister Serpent”, and “Vampire Lord”.</li>
  <li>If your “Dark Flare Knight” is sent to the Graveyard while “Skill Drain” is active, its effect activates in the Graveyard so you can Special Summon “Mirage Knight” (but “Mirage Knight”’s effects will be negated once it is in play).</li>
  <li>If your “Neko Mane King” is sent to the Graveyard by your opponent’s card effect while “Skill Drain” is active, its effect is activated.</li>
  <li>If your “Twin-Headed Behemoth” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while “Skill Drain” is active, its effect activates and it is Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>“Skill Drain” will not negate an Ignition Effect or Trigger Effect if the Effect Monster is not face-up on the field when the effect resolves.</li>
  <li>“Skill Drain” does not stop you from activating Ignition Effects, but it does negate their effects as long as the Effect Monster remains on the field. If you Tribute “Cannon Soldier” to itself while “Skill Drain” is active, “Cannon Soldier”’s effect is not negated because “Cannon Soldier” is in the Graveyard, but if you Tribute a different monster for “Cannon Soldier”’s effect, then the effect is negated and your opponent takes no damage. Likewise, if you activate “Winged Minion”’s effect while “Skill Drain” is active, “Winged Minion” is no longer on the field and its effect resolves. If you activate “Exiled Force”’s effect while “Skill Drain” is active, “Exiled Force” is no longer on the field and you can select and destroy 1 monster on the field. If you Tribute “Paladin of White Dragon” to activate its effect while “Skill Drain” is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon “Blue-Eyes White Dragon”. If you Tribute “Great Dezard” while “Skill Drain” is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon “Fushioh Richie”.</li>
  <li>“Skill Drain” will negate Flip Effects, and you can chain the activation of “Skill Drain” to the activation of a Flip Effect, but you cannot activate “Skill Drain” in the Damage Step because it does not specifically modify ATK or DEF, so you cannot chain “Skill Drain” to a Flip Effect that is activated because a monster was attacked while face-down.</li>
  <li>If you Flip Summon “Spear Cretin” while “Skill Drain” is active, “Spear Cretin”’s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and “Skill Drain” negates Flip Effects.</li>
  <li>“Skill Drain” negates Multi-Trigger Effects such as “Dark Paladin” and “Ryu Senshi”.</li>
  <li>While “Skill Drain” is active you cannot Tribute a face-up “Kaiser Seahorse” to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher LIGHT monster. However, you can Tribute a face-down “Kaiser Seahorse”.</li>
  <li>While “Skill Drain” is active, “maintenance costs” are not negated (see the Advanced Gameplay FAQ) so you still have to pay for “The Unfriendly Amazon”, “Armor Exe”, Archfiends, etc. However, all other costs are negated, so you do not have to pay to attack with “Dark Elf” or “Jirai Gumo”.</li>
  <li>Restrictions are also lifted, so you can attack with “Ultimate Obedient Fiend” even if you have other cards on your side of the field.</li>
  <li>Spirit Monsters are not returned to the owner’s hand while “Skill Drain” is active.</li>
  <li>Toon Monsters’ effects are negated while “Skill Drain” is active and the Toon Monster is on the field, so they can attack the same turn they are Summoned, you do not have to pay 500 Life Points to attack with them, and they are not destroyed if “Toon World” is destroyed, but they cannot attack your opponent directly.</li>
  <li>“Jinzo” cannot negate Trap Cards while “Skill Drain” is already active, because “Skill Drain” is negating “Jinzo”’s effect. But if “Jinzo” is already on the field, you cannot activate “Skill Drain” because “Jinzo”’s effect prevents you from doing so.</li>
  <li>When a monster’s ATK or DEF are changed by its own effect, like “Slate Warrior” or “Berserk Dragon”, and “Skill Drain” is activated, that monster’s effect is negated and the ATK/DEF are returned to normal. Even if “Skill Drain” is then destroyed, the old adjustment to ATK/DEF does not come back. Any bonuses or penalties are lost when “Skill Drain” effect is applied, and you have to start over from the beginning.</li>
  <li>If your opponent uses “Bazoo the Soul-Eater”’s effect to increase its ATK, and you use “Skill Drain”, “Bazoo the Soul-Eater”’s ATK returns to normal, even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed after resolving. If “Skill Drain” is negating “Bazoo the Soul-Eater”’s effect, you can still pay the cost and remove monsters in your Graveyard from play, but “Bazoo the Soul-Eater”’s ATK will not increase.</li>
  <li>“Goblin Attack Force” and “Spear Dragon” do not change their battle position after attacking while “Skill Drain” is active. If “Goblin Attack Force” attacks and changes battle position, then on your next turn you activate “Skill Drain”, you can change “Goblin Attack Force” back to Attack Position because its effect that prevents this is negated.</li>
  <li>Monsters equipped to “Relinquished” while “Skill Drain” is active are negated and destroyed because “Relinquished” no longer has an effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and “Relinquished”’s ATK and DEF are returned to normal.</li>
  <li>Monsters that can hold Spell Counters, like “Skilled Dark Magician”, no longer have that effect while “Skill Drain” is active, so they cannot gain more Spell Counters and all Spell Counters already placed on them are removed.</li>
  <li>If a face-down “Kisetai” is attacked while “Skill Drain” is active, the effect of “Kisetai” is negated, damage calculation is performed, and “Kisetai” will not equip itself to the attacking monster. But if “Kisetai” is already an Equip Spell Card, and “Skill Drain” is activated, Kisetai is unaffected because it is no longer an Effect Monster.</li>
  <li>The effects of “Zombyra the Dark” are negated while “Skill Drain” is active, so “Zombyra the Dark” can attack your opponent directly, and its ATK is not decreased because of its effect. If “Skill Drain” is destroyed, “Zombyra the Dark”’s ATK is not changed.</li>
  <li>The ATK and DEF of “Gradius’ Option”, the ATK of “Maju Garzett”, and similar monsters is 0 while “Skill Drain” is active, and is not restored even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is activated after “Hayabusa Knight”’s first attack, “Hayabusa Knight” does not get its second attack.</li>
  <li>You can Special Summon “Gilasaurus” while “Skill Drain” is active, but its effect is negated so your opponent does not get to Special Summon.</li>
  <li>Do not roll dice for Archfiends while “Skill Drain” is active.</li>
  <li>A Union Monster that attached itself to another monster before “Skill Drain” became active is unaffected by “Skill Drain”. If “Skill Drain” is active, you can activate a Union Monster’s effect to attach it to another monster, but nothing happens and it remains a monster.</li>
  <li>“Skill Drain” will not affect lingering effects or conditions that are left over from a previous effect. For example, if you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with “Summoner of Illusions”, and then “Skill Drain” is activated afterwards, the Fusion Monster is still destroyed in the End Phase. If you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with “Magical Scientist”, and then “Skill Drain” is activated, the Fusion Monster cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly, and is returned to the Fusion Deck at the end of the turn.</li>
  <li>When “Jowls of Dark Demise”’s effect is activated and resolves, and then “Skill Drain” is activated afterwards, it has no effect on “Jowls of Dark Demise”’s effect, so control of the monster does not change until it is returned to the original controller at the end of the turn.</li>
  <li>If “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi”’s effect is activated, and then “Skill Drain” is activated later, “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi”’s effect is not negated and the opponent must discard his/her hand during their next Draw Phase. But if “Skill Drain” is active at the time “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi”’s effect activates, then the effect is negated.</li>
  <li>Conditions for Summoning monsters is not negated by “Skill Drain”, so you still must remove 1 DARK and 1 LIGHT monster to Special Summon “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, and you cannot Normal Summon or Flip Summoning “Terrorking Archfiend” if there are no Archfiends on the field.</li>
  <li>You can have 2 “Gravekeeper’s Chiefs” on the field while “Skill Drain” is active, but if “Skill Drain” is destroyed, select 1 of the “Gravekeeper’s Chiefs” and destroy it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="skilled-dark-magician">SKILLED DARK MAGICIAN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You place a Spell Counter on this monster when the Spell Card resolves, so if “Magic Jammer” is used to negate the Spell Card’s activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if “Imperial Order” is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated.</li>
  <li>If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Skilled Dark Magician, “Skilled Dark Magician” does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because “Skilled Dark Magician” must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.</li>
  <li>You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.</li>
  <li>When you use the effect of a Continuous Spell Card that is already face-up on the field, such as “Inspection”, or sending “Wave-Motion Cannon” to the Graveyard, or paying for “Messenger of Peace”, you do NOT place a Spell Counter on this monster.</li>
  <li>When “Double Spell” is played, you get a Spell Counter on this monster for the activation of “Double Spell”, but not for the target of “Double Spell” because the target is never activated; so you get 1 Spell Counter on this monster.</li>
  <li>You do not place a Spell Counter on this monster when you attach or detach a Union Monster because that is not the activation of a Spell Card.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Monster Reborn” or “Premature Burial” to revive this monster, this monster does not get a Spell Counter for “Monster Reborn” (it has to be face-up on the field before the activation of the Spell Card).</li>
  <li>You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.</li>
  <li>This monster’s effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon “Dark Magician” from your Graveyard and your opponent chains “Disappear” and removes that “Dark Magician”, you can Special Summon a different “Dark Magician” from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.</li>
  <li>If there is no “Dark Magician” in your hand/Deck/Graveyard you can still activate this effect but your opponent can verify the contents to make certain, and then the effect disappears.</li>
  <li>When “Skill Drain” is active, and you or your opponent activates a Spell Card, do not place Spell Counters on this monster. Any Spell Counters that are on this monster are removed when “Skill Drain” is activated.</li>
  <li>If a player controls the opponent’s “Skilled Dark Magician” and Tribute it with 3 Spell Counters, the player who controlled and Tributed the “Skilled Dark Magician” is the player who Special Summons “Dark Magician” from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

But if “Imperial Order” is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated.</li>
  <li>If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Skilled White Magician”, “Skilled White Magician” does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because “Skilled White Magician” must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.</li>
  <li>You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.</li>

  <li>You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.</li>
  <li>This monster’s effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon “Buster Blader” from your Graveyard and your opponent chains “Disappear” and removes that “Buster Blader”, you can Special Summon a different “Buster Blader” from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.</li>
  <li>If there is no “Buster Blader” in your hand/Deck/Graveyard you can still activate this effect but your opponent can verify the contents to make certain, and then the effect disappears.</li>

<h4 id="skull-knight-2">SKULL KNIGHT #2</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you Tribute Set a high level Fiend-Type monster by Tributing this card, you CAN Special Summon another “Skull Knight #2” from your Deck and you do NOT have to reveal your Set monster to prove it is a Fiend-Type.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Blade Knight” destroys a Flip Effect Monster like “Slate Warrior”, even that monster’s non-Flip effects are negated. So in this case, “Slate Warrior” does not reduce the ATK and DEF of the “Blade Knight” that destroyed it, because “Blade Knight” negates its effect.</li>
  <li>“Gorgon’s Eye” cannot negate the effect of “Sangan”, “Witch of the Black Forest”, or “Sinister Serpent” because they activate in the Graveyard. If a Defense Position “Slate Warrior” is attacked and destroyed, the effect of “Slate Warrior” that lowers ATK and DEF is applied because it activates in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “Grave Protector” is on the field, the effect of “Slate Warrior” that reduces the ATK and DEF of the monster that destroys “Slate Warrior” is still applied, even though “Slate Warrior” is shuffled back into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard.

<h4 id="smoke-grenade-of-the-thief">SMOKE GRENADE OF THE THIEF</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card must be destroyed directly for its effect to activate, such as with the effects of “Mystical Space Typhoon”, “Heavy Storm”, or “Gearfried the Iron Knight”. Its effect does NOT activate if the monster it is equipped to is destroyed, Tributed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field.</li>

  <li>If the opponent chains “Dust Tornado” or “Mystical Space Typhoon” to the activation of “Smoke Grenade of the Thief”, it is destroyed and its effect is NOT activated. This is because it is an Equip Spell Card, and must be on the field when it resolves for its effect to activate.</li>

  <li>If your opponent equips “Snatch Steal” to your “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, the effect of “Snatch Steal” resolves first and control changes. Then the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates and your opponent gets to select which monster is destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you control your opponent’s monster because of “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal”, and remove the monster with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, the monster returns to your side of the field, then immediately returns to your opponent’s side of the field.</li>
  <li>When your opponent activates “Snatch Steal”, and you chain “Ojama Trio” to fill up his/her remaining Monster Zones, then there is no room for the stolen monster, and it is destroyed.</li>
  <li>When “Snatch Steal” is active, the +1000 Life Points effect is applied even if “Remove Brainwashing” has returned control of the monster to the original owner.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If a player has all 5 Monster Zone spaces full when their opponent’s “Snatch Steal” is destroyed, what will happen to the monster their opponent was controlling with the destroyed “Snatch Steal”?<br />
A: The returning monster would be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/28/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If I have used “Snatch Steal” on a monster from another turn and activate “Tailor of the Fickle” on “Snatch Steal,” can I steal another monster and keep both, or do I only get one?<br />
A: You would keep the new equipped monster. The monster formerly equipped with “Snatch Steal” would return to your opponent’s side of the field. Steve Okegawa, 12/14/2003</li>
  <li>Q: Can “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” be activated to destroy an opponent’s monster if all 5 Monster Zone spaces are full or does it only happen during the resolution of a chain?<br />
A: It is during the resolution of a chain. If you do not have any empty zones in your Monster Zone you cannot activate “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” to take control of an opponent’s monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Say Player A plays “Snatch Steal” on Player B’s “Jinzo”. Then Player B uses “Change of Heart” on “Jinzo” and then “Book of Moon”. What would happen to “Jinzo”?<br />
A: During the End Phase “Jinzo” would return to the previous controller. Player A, based on your example. Curtis Schultz, 01/18/2004</li>

  <li>“Solemn Judgment” can not be used to negate a Special Summon if that Special Summon occurs as a result of another card effect.</li>
  <li>Special Summon monsters like “Dark Necrofear” that have their summons negated by “Solemn Judgment” are not considered properly summoned and may not be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.</li>

<h4 id="sonic-jammer">SONIC JAMMER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you activate “Sonic Jammer” during your turn, it lasts until the end of your opponent’s End Phase. If you activate “Sonic Jammer” during your opponent’s turn, it lasts until the end of your End Phase.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is activated after “Sonic Jammer”’s effect has resolved, the effect of “Sonic Jammer” is not negated because “Skill Drain” was not active when “Sonic Jammer” was flipped, activated its effect, and applied its effect.</li>
  <li>While “Sonic Jammer”’s effect is applied, your opponent can still use the effects of “Wave Motion Cannon”, or “Black Pendant” when sent to the Graveyard, or Field Spell Cards like “Fusion Gate”.</li>
  <li>While “Sonic Jammer”’s effect is applied, your opponent cannot activate “Spiritualism”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="soul-absorption">SOUL ABSORPTION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Soul Absorption”’s effect is based on the number of cards, not on each “lump sum” of cards. So if 3 DARK monsters are removed from the Graveyard to Special Summon “Dark Necrofear”, the controller of “Soul Absorption” gains 1500 Life Points.</li>
  <li>However, you receive the Life Points from “Soul Absorption” as a “lump sum”, so in the case of “Dark Necrofear” you gain 1500 Life Points but your “Fire Princess” would only do 500 points of damage.</li>
  <li>“Soul Absorption” is a “trigger-like” Continuous Spell Card, not a “continuous-like” Continuous Spell Card, so activate its effect after the current chain resolves that includes removing cards from play.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Soul Absorption” can, itself, be chained to after it activates.</li>
  <li>If “Soul Absorption”’s effect activates in response to the Special Summon of a monster like “Dark Necrofear” or “Inferno”, Soul Absorption’s effect activates after the monster is Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>For “Chaosrider Gustapth”, activate “Soul Absorption”’s effect after “Chaosrider Gustaph”’s effect resolves.</li>
  <li>Your “Soul Absorption”’s effect activates even when your opponent’s cards are removed.</li>

<h4 id="soul-demolition">SOUL DEMOLITION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer” is on the field, the effect of this card cannot be activated.</li>
  <li>Paying 500 Life Points is a cost.</li>
  <li>You must select the monster in the Graveyard you wish to target when you activate this card’s effect. You select before the opponent does. After you select the opponent may chain, with a card like “Dust Tornado”, to destroy “Soul Demolition”. In this case its effect will not resolve and no monsters will be removed. This is because it is a Continuous Trap Card and it must remain on the field for its effect to resolve. If the effect is negated you do not get a refund of the 500 Life Point cost.</li>
  <li>If the opponent chains to the effect of “Soul Demolition” with an effect that destroys all the Fiend-Type monsters on your side of the field, the effect of “Soul Demolition” resolves because the activation conditions were correct at the time.</li>
  <li>If you chain the effect of “Soul Demolition” to “Monster Reborn” and remove the monster targeted by “Monster Reborn” from play, the effect of “Monster Reborn” disappears.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="soul-exchange">SOUL EXCHANGE</h4>

  <li>Since “Soul Exchange” targets, “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

  <li>If the effect of “Soul Exchange” is not used in the turn that “Soul Exchange” has been activated, the effect of “Soul Exchange” disappears.</li>
  <li>Monsters targeted by “Soul Exchange” may be used for a Ritual Summon.</li>
  <li>If “Soul Exchange” targets “Spirit Reaper,” “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: When is the monster targeted by “Soul Exchange” Tributed?<br />

  <li>If you have another Zombie-Type monster and “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower”, your opponent cannot attack the “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower”, but if you equip the “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower” with “Ring of Magnetism” your opponent can declare an attack but must attack the “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower” equipped with the “Ring of Magnetism”.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple “Soul-Absorbing Bone Towers” and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack.</li>
  <li>When your opponent attacks your “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower” and during the Battle Step you activate “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon another Zombie-Type monster, then a replay occurs (and you send 2 cards from your opponent’s Deck to the Graveyard).</li>

  <li>If you have “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower” and “Card of Safe Return”, and a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned, “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower” is Step 1 of the chain and “Card of Safe Return” is Step 2.</li>
  <li>You can chain to “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower”’s effect that sends 2 cards to the Graveyard.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>“Spatial Collapse” includes Tokens, too.</li>

  <li>When you have 4 cards on your side of the field while “Spatial Collapse” is active, you cannot activate “Change of Heart”.</li>
  <li>When “Cyber Jar” is activated while “Spatial Collapse” is active, if the number of cards exceeds 5, each player selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.</li>

  <li>When a card that selects a card in the Graveyard as a target, such as “Monster Reborn”, “Mask of Darkness”, “Magician of Faith”, “Spear Cretin”, or “The Shallow Grave”, is activated, you may chain “Disappear” to remove the targeted card from play, and the “Monster Reborn”, etc., will resolve without effect. This is because these cards select their target at activation, not resolution.</li>
  <li>If you Flip Summon “Spear Cretin” while “Skill Drain” is active, “Spear Cretin”’s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and “Skill Drain” negates Flip Effects.</li>
  <li>If “The End of Anubis” is face-up on the field when a flipped “Spear Cretin” is sent to the Graveyard, then “Spear Cretin’s” effect does not activate. But if “The End of Anubis” was merely on the field when “Spear Cretin” was flipped, but is NOT on the field when “Spear Cretin” is sent to the Graveyard, then “Spear Cretin’s” effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because “The End of Anubis” is no longer on the field to negate it.</li>

  <li>“Spear Dragon” will change to Defense Position after it attacks, regardless of the battle position of the opponent’s monster.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Spear Dragon” does not prevent you from manually changing its battle position later on. Of course, you cannot change it in the same turn after you attacked with “Spear Dragon”. But during your next turn you can change it back to Attack Position (and attack again the same turn, if you choose).</li>
  <li>If you attack your opponent’s Defense Position monster with 0 DEF with your “Spear Dragon”, and have “Dragon’s Rage” active on the field, the opponent only takes 1900 points of damage. The effects are not cumulative.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="spell-absorption">SPELL ABSORPTION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Spell Absorption” is applied when the Spell Card is activated. You cannot chain to this effect. The effect is applied immediately. For example, when activating “Tribute to the Doomed” while “Spell Absorption” is on the field: (1) pay the cost by discarding a card, (2) activate “Tribute to the Doomed”, (3) your Life Points increase for “Spell Absorption”, (4) check for chaining and resolve “Tribute to the Doomed”.</li>
  <li>If the activation of a Spell Card is negated by “Magic Jammer”, etc., then you will not gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption”.</li>
  <li>A Spell Card used from the Graveyard by the effect of “Double Spell” is not considered “activated”, so you will only gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption” for “Double Spell” itself, not for the card used from the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When you activate “Spell Absorption”, you do not gain Life Points for activating “Spell Absorption” itself.</li>
</ul>

  <li>You can Special Summon “Spell Canceller” with “Premature Burial”; the effect of “Premature Burial” is negated by “Spell Canceller” so if “Premature Burial” is destroyed, “Spell Canceller” is not destroyed and remains on the field.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Call of the Haunted” to a Spell Card, and Special Summon “Spell Canceller”, to negate the effect of the Spell Card.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Spiritualism” when “Spell Canceller” is face-up on the field because its activation and effect cannot be negated.</li>
  <li>When “Spell Canceller” is face-up on the field, you can activate the Graveyard effect of “Dark Necrofear” (because it is a monster effect) and equip it to a monster, but the effect of “Dark Necrofear” after it is equipped will be negated because it is then an Equip Spell Card.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="spell-economics">SPELL ECONOMICS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Only the controller of “Spell Economics” gets its effect.</li>
  <li>You have to pay for “Chain Energy” even if you control “Spell Economics”.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="spellbinding-circle">SPELLBINDING CIRCLE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Battle Position of a monster targeted by this card can still be changed by card effects, such as “Book of Moon”, “Stop Defense”, etc.</li>
  <li>This card may select a face-down monster as a target. This prevents the monster from being Flip Summoned, but it will still be flipped face-up if it is the target of an attack.</li>
  <li>If the targeted monster is Tributed, changed into an Equip Spell Card by the effect of “Relinquished”, returned to the owner’s hand, or otherwise removed from the field without being destroyed, “Spellbinding Circle” remains on the field meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Spellbinding Circle” to the activation of a Flip Effect when a monster is Flip Summoned or flipped face-up, but it will not negate the activation or resolution of the Flip Effect.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Change of Heart” and take control of a monster targeted by “Spellbinding Circle” but you cannot attack with it or change its Battle Position.</li>

<h4 id="spirit-barrier">SPIRIT BARRIER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You still perform damage calculation with “Spirit Barrier” even though the damage to the controller’s Life Points becomes zero.</li>
  <li>If you have 1 monster on the field, and “Airknight Parshath” attack and destroys it, and would do extra damage, there is still a monster on the field when “Airknight Parshath”’s effect would activate and resolve, so “Spirit Barrier”’s effect is applied, “Airknight Parshath” inflicts zero damage to your Life Points, and your opponent does not draw 1 card for “Airknight Parshath”’s effect.</li>

<h4 id="spirit-elimination">SPIRIT ELIMINATION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Spirit of the Pharaoh” cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of “The First Sarcophagus”. So “Spirit of the Pharaoh” cannot be Special Summoned with “Monster Reborn”, etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.</li>
  <li>If your opponent chains “Royal Decree” to the effect of “The First Sarcophagus”, the effect of Special Summoning is negated and “The First Sarcophagus” is sent to the Graveyard because that is the cost.</li>
  <li>If “Banisher of the Light” is in play and you activate “The First Sarcophagus”, you cannot Special Summon “Spirit of the Pharaoh”.</li>

  <li>“Spirit of the Pharaoh”’s effect targets.</li>
  <li>You can choose whether or not to activate “Spirit of the Pharaoh”’s effect, but if you activate it you must Special Summon at least 1 Zombie-Type monster.</li>
  <li>If you have “Stumbling” on the field and “Spirit of the Pharaoh” is Special Summoned, his effect can be activated but it is a chain with “Stumbling” as Step 1 and “Spirit of the Pharaoh” as Step 2.</li>
  <li>If a Zombie-Type monster had its Level reduced by “Cost Down”, that reduction no longer applies when it is in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Spirit of the Pharaoh”’s effect and “Enemy Controller” is chained, and control of “Spirit of the Pharaoh” switches, the effect is still controlled by the activator of “Spirit of the Pharoah”’s effect.</li>

<h4 id="spirit-reaper">SPIRIT REAPER</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While in Defense Position, “Spirit Reaper” will stop all Battle Damage to your Life Points from most monsters, but monsters like “Spear Dragon” and those equipped with “Fairy Meteor Crush” can still inflict Battle Damage to your Life Points with their effects.</li>
  <li>If attacked while face-down, “Spirit Reaper” flips face-up and its effect preventing it from being destroyed will be applied during damage calculation, so “Spirit Reaper” will not be destroyed by the attack.</li>
  <li>If “Spirit Reaper” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, “Spirit Reaper” isn’t destroyed during damage calculation, so the effect of “Dark Ruler Ha Des” does not activate.</li>
  <li>When “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by an effect, “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by its own effect AFTER resolving the effect that targeted it. For example, if “Spirit Reaper” attacks and “Magic Cylinder” is activated, designating “Spirit Reaper”, first “Magic Cylinder” will resolve, negate the attack, and inflict 300 damage to the controller of “Spirit Reaper”. Then, after that, “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by its effect.</li>
  <li>“Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by its own effect after a card that targets it resolves. If a Spell Card targets it, and the activation of that Spell Card is negated (such as with “Magic Jammer”), then “Spirit Reaper” is not destroyed. However, if the effect of the Spell Card was negated, such as if “Imperial Order” is active, then “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed because the Spell Card resolves (even though its effect is negated). Even if “Imperial Order” is already active on the field, you can activate a card such as “Tribute to the Doomed” designating “Spirit Reaper”, and “Spirit Reaper” will be destroyed by its own effect.</li>
  <li>“Spirit Reaper” is only destroyed by its own effect if it is face-up on the field when the effect designating it as a target activates, AND after the effect designating it as a target resolves. If you Special Summon “Spirit Reaper” with Monster Reborn, or flip it face-down with “Book of Moon”, or flip it face-up with “Book of Taiyou”, it is not destroyed. If a face-down “Spirit Reaper” is targeted with “Change of Heart”, then Flip Summoned, it is not destroyed because it was face-down when “Change of Heart” was activated. If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by the effect of “Relinquished”, “Spirit Reaper” is an Equip Spell Card after the effect of “Relinquished” resolves, so it is not destroyed. If “Spirit Reaper” is removed from play with “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Different Dimension Gate”, then it is removed from play so it is not destroyed. If “Spirit Reaper” is shuffled into the Deck with “Monster Recovery”, it’s not destroyed. If “Spirit Reaper” is returned to the hand with “Penguin Soldier”, it’s not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by its effect during the Damage Step, such as if “Rush Recklessly” was activated to increase its ATK, destroy “Spirit Reaper” with its effect AFTER damage calculation.</li>
  <li>“Spirit Reaper” is destroyed if equipped, including with “Heart of Clear Water”.</li>
  <li>Examples of cards that will not destroy “Spirit Reaper” because they do not target: “Creature Swap”, “Adhesion Trap Hole”, “Spear Dragon”.</li>
  <li>Since “Soul Exchange” targets, “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.</li>
  <li>“Spirit Reaper” has a special effect for when it isn’t destroyed (as a result of battle), and a special effect for an extra reason to destroy it (when targeted by an effect). But it can still be destroyed by all other normal effects that would destroy a monster: “Cyber Jar”, “Raigeki”, etc.</li>
  <li>If “Spirit Reaper” is Special Summoned with “Premature Burial” or “Call of the Haunted”, “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed after it is Special Summoned because it is targeted by an effect.</li>
  <li>“Spirit Reaper” only forces your opponent to discard when “Spirit Reaper” attacks directly (such as when your opponent has no monsters on the field), AND when it inflicts at least 1 point of damage to the opponent’s Life Points. So if your opponent uses “Kuriboh”, “Waboku”, or “Tornado Wall” to prevent the damage, “Spirit Reaper” does not force the opponent to discard.</li>
  <li>“Dreamsprite” targets 1 of your own monsters. If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted, it is destroyed after damage calculation.</li>
  <li>“Patrician of Darkness” does not target, so “Spirit Reaper” is not destroyed if you use “Patrician of Darkness” to force your opponent to attack it.</li>
  <li>If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by “Riryoku”, it is destroyed, but the increase to the other monster’s ATK lasts until the end of the turn as normal.</li>
  <li>If a Spellcaster affected by “Diffusion Wave-Motion” attacks “Spirit Reaper”, it’s just a normal attack. “Spirit Reaper” is not being targeted by “Diffusion Wave-Motion”.</li>
  <li>If “Skill Drain” is active, “Spirit Reaper” can be equiped with Equip Cards, but if “Skill Drain” is later removed from the field “Spirit Reaper” wil be destroyed.</li>
  <li>“Spirit Reaper” can be destroyed as a result of battle while “Skill Drain” is active.</li>
</ul>

  <li>If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by a card during the Damage Step, Damage Calculation resolves as normal and then “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect.</li>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Bob activates Snatch Steal targeting Spirit Reaper. Andrew chains Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy Snatch Steal. Does Spirit Reaper still destroy itself?<br />
A: “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed after the card that targets it resolves. “Snatch Steal” is an Equip Card. Since “Snatch Steal” was destroyed before it could resolve, it’s effect disappears and does not resolve. Since “Snatch Steal” doesn’t resolve, “Spirit Reaper” is not destroyed.

<p>Other Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Spirit Ryu’s” effect can only be activated in the Battle Step. This is where the attack is declared. Because you can activate multiple chains during this step, as long as you have Dragons in your hand, you can discard them 1 at a time to keep [using] “Spirit Ryu’s” effect. You can’t discard, say, 4 in one shot. 1 at a time and your opponent gets the chance to respond/chain. Andrew Roth, 6/21/2005</li>

<h4 id="stamping-destruction">STAMPING DESTRUCTION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you activate this card, if the opponent activates an effect in a chain that destroys the targeted Spell or Trap Card, the opponent will not take the 500 points of damage. If your opponent merely chains the Spell or Trap card that you targeted, the Spell or Trap Card will be destroyed when “Stamping Destruction” resolves and your opponent will take 500 points of damage. (Remember that Spell and Trap Cards remain on the field until the entire chain resolves, unless destroyed by a card effect during the chain.)</li>
  <li>If your opponent destroys all the Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as a chain to the activation of this card, this card will still resolve since the conditions were met at the time of activation.</li>

<h4 id="statue-of-the-wicked">STATUE OF THE WICKED</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This card is only activated if sent from the field to the Graveyard. There is no way to activate this card while it is Set on the field.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Statue of the Wicked” is activated in the Graveyard, so its effect is activated even if “Jinzo” is on the field, because “Jinzo” only applies to Trap Cards and Trap Card effects on the field. Also, cards like “Seven Tools of the Bandit” cannot be used against “Statue of the Wicked”.</li>
  <li>“Statue of the Wicked” activates its effect even if it is destroyed on the same turn it was Set.</li>
  <li>If “Banisher of the Light” is in play, then “Statue of the Wicked” does not activate its effect when destroyed, because it is not sent to the Graveyard.</li>

  <li>When you select “Spirit Reaper” or “The Reaper on the Nightmare” as the target of “Staunch Defender”, resolve the chain, and after the effect of “Staunch Defender” resolves, the selected monster is destroyed.

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” declares an attack and the opponent activates “Staunch Defender”, will all other face-up monsters have to attack?<br />
A: It depends on “Thousand Eyes Restrict” surviving the attack.

If it does not survive and is sent to the Graveyard or otherwise removed from the field, then any other face-up monsters on your side of the field would have to attack the selected monster.

<h4 id="stumbling">STUMBLING</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of “Stumbling” goes on a chain immediately after a monster is Summoned. As a mandatory Trigger Effect, “Stumbling” is always on the chain before optional Trigger Effects (“Mobius the Frost Monarch”) or chained Spell &amp; Trap Cards (“Trap Hole”).</li>
  <li>“Stumbling” changes a monster to face-up Defense Position, not face-down Defense Position.</li>

  <li>If “Stumbling” is in effect and you Summon “Exiled Force”, and your opponent has “Trap Hole” Set, “Stumbling” initiates a chain with “Stumbling”’s effect as Step 1. Your opponent can activate “Trap Hole” as Step 2. You cannot chain “Exiled Force” because its effect is Spell Speed 1. Therefore “Trap Hole” will destroy “Exiled Force” before you have a chance to Tribute it.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While “Royal Decree” and “Talisman of Spell Sealing” are both active, and “Sealmaster Meisei” is removed from the field, “Talisman of Spell Sealing” stays on the field, but if “Royal Decree”’s effect is no longer being applied, “Talisman of Spell Sealing” is destroyed.</li>

<h4 id="taunt">TAUNT</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a monster selected by “Taunt” is moved to the turn player’s side of the field, the turn player can conduct attacks normally without worrying about the effect of “Taunt”, because without a card effect that allows it, a player cannot attack monsters on his own side of the field.</li>
  <li>If multiple monsters are selected by multiple “Taunts”, the turn player selects 1 of the monsters selected by “Taunt” and can attack it.</li>
  <li>If 1 monster is selected by “Taunt” and another is equipped with “Ring of Magnetism”, the turn player must attack the monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” if he attacks.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The Agent of Force - Mars” is unaffected by Spell Cards just like “Guardian Kay’est” and “The Legendary Fisherman”.</li>
  <li>Vs. “Reverse Trap”, “The Agent of Force - Mars”’ ATK &amp; DEF become zero but cannot go below zero.</li>
  <li>If “The Agent of Force - Mars” attacks “Reflect Bounder”, “Reflect Bounder” deals damage based on “The Agent of Force - Mars”’ current ATK, so if it has 2000 ATK, then “Reflect Bounder” inflicts 2000 damage; then recalculate “The Agent of Force - Mars”’ ATK before performing damage calculation.</li>
  <li>When your face-down Defense Position “The Agent of Force - Mars” is attacked, its DEF is increased BEFORE damage calculation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-agent-of-judgment---saturn">THE AGENT OF JUDGMENT - SATURN</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tributing “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn” is a cost.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”’s effect during Main Phase 2. You CAN activate “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”’s effect during Main Phase 1 even if you have to skip your Battle Phase because of a card effect.</li>
  <li>You can activate multiple “The Agent of Judgment - Saturns”’ effects in the same turn.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”’s effect.</li>
  <li>If you chain “Mystical Space Typhoon” to “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”’s effect and destroy “The Sanctuary in the Sky”, “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”’s effect disappears but it has already been Tributed so it is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If “The Sanctuary in the Sky” is not on the field, you can Tribute “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn” and activate the effect, but the effect is not applied and disappears.</li>
  <li>If an effect is chained to “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”’s effect that would increase your opponent’s Life Points, so that your opponent’s Life Points are higher than yours when its effect resolves, then “The Agent of Judgment - Saturn”’s effect disappears because your Life Points need to be higher than your opponent’s when the effect resolves.</li>
  <li>Damage is calculated and inflicted when the effect resolves, so calculate the exact damage when resolving the effect, including any chained effects that altered the Life Points since activation; if the Life Points have changed since activation, the damage inflicted changes accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-agent-of-wisdom---mercury">THE AGENT OF WISDOM - MERCURY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When it is the END of your opponent’s End Phase and you have no hand, then “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury”’s effect activates. So if you activate “Dust Tornado” during your opponent’s End Phase, and Set your last card in your hand, and have no cards at the end of the End Phase, “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury”’s effect activates.</li>
  <li>If your hand was increased during the End Phase by activating “Jar of Greed”, and you have a card in your hand at the end of the End Phase, then “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury”’s effect does not activate.</li>
  <li>If your Standby Phase is skipped then “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury”’s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury” you can draw multiple times.</li>
  <li>When the effect of “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury” is negated by “Skill Drain”, and you have no hand at the end of your opponent’s End Phase, and you destroy “Skill Drain” before your “Standby Phase” (such as with “Mystical Space Typhoon” during your Draw Phase), you CAN draw because “Skill Drain” was destroyed. This is because the “when you have no cards in your hand during your opponent’s End Phase” is a condition, not an effect, so it is not negated by “Skill Drain”. As long as you can make it so that “Skill Drain” is not negating “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury”’s card-drawing effect by the time the Standby Phase begins, you can draw.</li>
  <li>When you have “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury” on your side of the field and you have no cards in your hand at the end of your opponent’s End Phase, but it is destroyed before your Standby Phase (such as with “Ring of Destruction” during your Draw Phase), then you do NOT draw during your Standby Phase because “The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury” is no longer on the field.</li>

<h4 id="the-big-march-of-animals">THE BIG MARCH OF ANIMALS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>“The Big March of Animals” does not affect monsters Summoned after it resolves.</li>
  <li>“The Big March of Animals” does not count or affect face-down monsters.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="the-creator">THE CREATOR</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard is not a cost to activate the effect of “The Creator”. It is part of the effect. So if your opponent chains “Disappear” to remove the targeted monster in your Graveyard from play, the effect of “The Creator” disappears and you do not send 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If you use the effect of “The Creator”, and then it is flipped face-down then flipped face-up again that same turn, you may use the effect of “The Creator” again.</li>
  <li>If you activate the effect of “The Creator”, and it does not resolve because the opponent chains “Skill Drain”, or removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard with “Disappear”, you’ve still used the effect. So you cannot activate its effect again that turn (even if you destroy “Skill Drain”).</li>
  <li>To Special Summon “The Creator” with the effect of “The Creator Incarnate”, you must Tribute a face-up “The Creator Incarnate” from the field, not from your hand, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-creator-incarnate">THE CREATOR INCARNATE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>

<h4 id="the-dark---hex-sealed-fusion">THE DARK - HEX-SEALED FUSION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you use this monster’s second effect, you also get its first effect. So this monster enables you to perform a Special Summon of a Fusion Monster without “Polymerization”, etc., and also acts as a “substitute” for one of the Fusion Material Monsters.</li>
  <li>Using the second effect of this monster does not “properly” Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. So it cannot be revived from the Graveyard, etc. If you use “Polymerization” then you can revive the Fusion Monster from the Graveyard, even if you used this monster as a “substitute” Fusion Material Monster.</li>
  <li>To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “B. Skull Dragon” you must Tribute “The Dark – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “Red-Eyes B. Dragon” or “Summoned Skull”.</li>
  <li>This monster’s second effect cannot be used to Special Summon Fusion Monsters that can only be Summoned by Fusion Summon, such as “Dark Paladin”.</li>

  <li>If the effect of “Weather Report” is used to gain an additional Battle Phase, one monster may attack once each Battle Phase.</li>

<h4 id="the-dragons-bead">THE DRAGON’S BEAD</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you first activate this card (flip it face-up) you do not have to activate its effect. You cannot flip this card and activate its effect in the same chain. (See “Chains, Activation, and Resolution” in the Advanced FAQ.)</li>
  <li>If “The Dragon’s Bead” is already face-up on the field, you may activate it multiple times in the same chain, but you must discard 1 card from you hand as a cost for each activation.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate the effect of “The Dragon’s Bead” during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate the effect of “The Dragon’s Bead” to negate a Trap Card that has already resolved, such as a “Nightmare Wheel” the opponent activated on a previous turn.</li>
  <li>You can only activate the effect of this card to negate a Trap Card that targets a face-up Dragon-Type monster, so it cannot negate “Mirror Force”, “Waboku”, “Torrential Tribute”, “Bottomless Trap Hole”, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<h4 id="the-earth---hex-sealed-fusion">THE EARTH - HEX-SEALED FUSION</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you use this monster’s second effect, you also get its first effect. So this monster enables you to perform a Special Summon of a Fusion Monster without “Polymerization”, etc., and also acts as a “substitute” for one of the Fusion Material Monsters.</li>
  <li>Using the second effect of this monster does not “properly” Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. So it cannot be revived from the Graveyard, etc. If you use “Polymerization” then you can revive the Fusion Monster from the Graveyard, even if you used this monster as a “substitute” Fusion Material Monster.</li>
  <li>To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “Master of Oz” you must Tribute “The Earth – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “Big Koala” or “Des Kangaroo”.</li>
  <li>This monster’s second effect cannot be used to Special Summon Fusion Monsters that can only be Summoned by Fusion Summon, such as “Dark Paladin”.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can chain “The Emperor’s Holiday” to “Premature Burial” and the effect of “Premature Burial” will be negated and the targeted monster will never leave the Graveyard. If “Premature Burial” is already active when you activate “The Emperor’s Holiday” the equipped monster is unaffected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: What happens to “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?<br />
A: The “Butterfly Dagger - Elma’s” effect would activate if destroyed while “The Emperor’s Holiday” is active. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</li>
  <li>Q: What happens to “Dark Necrofear” (as an Equip Spell Card) when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?<br />
A: The monster “Dark Necrofear” is equipped would return to its previous controller. The “Dark Necrofear” will remain equipped to the monster. Curtis Schultz, 02/03/2004</li>
  <li>Q: What happens to “Relinquished” (equipped with an opponent’s monster) when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?<br />
A: “Relinquished” will still retain the ATK and DEF stats of the equipped monster. This would be the same as when “Imperial Order” is active. Curtis Schultz, 02/03/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-end-of-anubis">THE END OF ANUBIS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The End of Anubis” WILL negate the effects of “Night Assailant” (its second effect), “Aswan Apparition”, “Nubian Guard”, “Sangan”, “Witch of the Black Forest” (even if Tributed to Tribute Summon “The End of Anubis”), “Mystic Tomato”/”Giant Rat”/etc., “Sinister Serpent”, “Magician of Faith”, “Dark Magician of Chaos”’ spell retrieval effect, “Vampire Lord”’s ability to return from the Graveyard, “Dark Necrofear”’s ability to return from the Graveyard, and activation of “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”.</li>
  <li>“The End of Anubis” WILL NOT negate the Special Summon of “Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End”, “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning”, “Dark Necrofear”, “Soul of Purity and Light”, etc. (because these involve costs, not effects, and “The End of Anubis” cannot negate paying costs). “The End of Anubis” WILL NOT negate “Strike Ninja”’s effect because removing 2 DARK monsters from the Graveyard is a cost.</li>
  <li>“The End of Anubis” WILL NOT negate the effect of “Fiend Comedian”, “Fiber Jar”, or “Big Burn”.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Call of the Haunted” to your opponent’s effect that targets a card in the Graveyard or activates in the Graveyard to Special Summon “The End of Anubis” and negate that effect.</li>
  <li>“The End of Anubis” negates the Special Summon effect of “Premature Burial” &amp; “Call of the Haunted”, but does not negate the effect that destroys the monster when “Premature Burial”/”Call of the Haunted” is destroyed.</li>
  <li>While “The End of Anubis” is on the field, if you Special Summon “Gilasaurus”, your opponent can’t Special Summon.</li>
  <li>If “The End of Anubis” is face-up on the field when a flipped “Spear Cretin” is sent to the Graveyard, then “Spear Cretin’s” effect does not activate. But if “The End of Anubis” was merely on the field when “Spear Cretin” was flipped, but is NOT on the field when “Spear Cretin” is sent to the Graveyard, then “Spear Cretin’s” effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because “The End of Anubis” is no longer on the field to negate it.</li>
  <li>When “Night Assailant” is discarded to activate the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus”, and Fiend is named, the effect of “Night Assailant” is activated after “Tribe-Infecting Virus” resolves because “The End of Anubis” is no longer on the field.</li>
  <li>You cannot send “Desrook Archfiend” to the Graveyard for its effect while “The End of Anubis” is on the field, because the effect of “Desrook Archfiend” targets the destroyed “Terrorking Archfiend” in the Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Judge List Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Exiled Force”, when Tributed for its effect, most certainly DOES activate in the Graveyard. This is the reason that its effect still activates if “Skill Drain” is on the field. Hence, its effect does not [resolve] if “The End of Anubis” is on the field. Kevin Tewart, 4/12/2005</li>
  <li>“The End of Anubis” will not negate the effect of “Wave-Motion Cannon” because the effect of “Wave-Motion Cannon” does not activate in the Graveyard. (This is the exact same reason that “Imperial Order” WILL negate the effect of “Wave-Motion Cannon” even if chained to the act of sending “Wave-Motion Cannon” from the field to the Graveyard.) Kevin Tewart, 10/06/2004</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-eye-of-truth">THE EYE OF TRUTH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When “The Eye of Truth” is activated in a chain you do not see your opponent’s hand until “The Eye of Truth” resolves. So if “The Eye of Truth” is step 3 in a 5 step chain, steps 5 and 4 will resolve, then “The Eye of Truth” resolves and your opponent reveals his/her hand, then steps 2 and 1 resolve.</li>
  <li>When “The Eye of Truth” is active and a card such as “Robbin’ Goblin” requires that the opponent discard a card from their hand randomly, the opponent should hide and shuffle his hand, discard a random card, and then reveal their hand again.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have all 3 Sarcophagi on your side of the field, the effect happens automatically; you have no choice in the matter.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple copies of “The First Sarcophagus”, each will have its own “Second Sarcophagus” and “Third Sarcophagus”. So if you have 2 of “TheFirst Sarcophagus”, you will have 2 of “The Second Sarcophagus” on the field. If you Special Summon “Spirit of the Pharaoh” or if 1 of the Sarcophagi is removed from the field, all Sarcophagi cards are sent to the Graveyard.</li>

<h4 id="the-hunter-with-7-weapons">THE HUNTER WITH 7 WEAPONS</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you declare an attack with this card against a monster of the selected Type, and the opponent activates “Mirror Wall”, the ATK will be halved first at attack declaration, and then increased by 1000 during damage calculation. So the final ATK will be 1500 = (1000/2) + 1000. Similarly, if the opponent activates the effect of “Fairy Box”, the ATK of this card will become 1000, because the 1000 point increase occurs after its ATK is reduced to 0.</li>

  <li>To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “St. Joan” you must Tribute “The Light – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “The Forgiving Maiden” or “Marie the Fallen One”.</li>

If you target an opponent’s monster, and then take control of it with “Change of Heart” and attack and do Battle Damage to your opponent, he/she will discard a card. If you target an opponent’s monster, and attack that monster with a weaker monster, causing Battle Damage to yourself, no one will discard a card. The monster targeted by your “The Secret of the Bandit” must deal Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points for the effect to activate.</li>
  <li>If the monster targeted by this card attacks directly and deals Battle Damage, this card’s effect will activate and the opponent must discard 1 card.</li>

If you do not pay the extra 500 when it is Summoned, you cannot later decide to pay and increase its ATK, it must be done when it is Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>The effect of Summoning “Theinen the Great Sphinx” is a Trigger Effect, so you may do it during your opponent’s turn if “Andro Sphinx” and “Sphinx Teleia” are destroyed simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Since Summoning “Theinen the Great Sphinx” is a Spell Speed 1 effect (Trigger Effect), you cannot chain multiple Special Summons of “Theinen the Great Sphinx” to one another. This means you can only Special Summon 1 copy of “Theinen the Great Sphinx” when the conditions are correct. You CANNOT pay 1000 Life Points to Special Summon 2 copies of this card.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If “Thousand Eyes Restrict” is Special Summoned and declares the activation of its effect on the opponent’s “Gemini Elf”, can the opponent activate “Ring of Destruction”?<br />
A: The player controlling the “Ring of Destruction” could activate it when “Thousand Eyes Restrict” targets “Gemini Elf” with its effect. They could destroy the “Gemini Elf” in a chain. You could use “Ring of Destruction” and target the “Thousand Eyes Restrict” if you want to. You would use the same chain I demonstrated earlier, only the “Thousand Eyes Restrict” would be destroyed and would not be able to resolve its effect properly. Curtis Schultz, 02/18/2004</li>

<p>GoatRulings.com Rulings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If I summon “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” and use its effect, what happens if my opponent chains a card that would flip-down or remove “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” from the field?<br />
A: For this example, say you declare the effect of “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” and your opponent chains “Book of Moon” to the effect. “Thousand-eyes Restrict” would be chain link 1 and “Book of Moon” would be chain link 2. In Yu-Gi-Oh! chains always resolve backwards. “Book of Moon” will resolve first, flipping down “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”. “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” needs to be face up on the field to attach a monster to itself, so its effect will “fizzle” and the targeted monster will remain on the field. This applies to cards such as (but not limited to) “Book of Moon”, “Ring of Destruction”, and “Compulsory Evacuation Device”.</li>

  <li>If you use “Cost Down” to make a Level 4 monster into a Level 2 monster, Summon it, and use “Thousand Energy”, during the End Phase you can choose which effect happens first, so you can restore it to Level 4 first by ending “Cost Down”’s effect, and then it will not be destroyed by the effect of “Thousand Energy”.</li>

A: In a nutshell, you must use “Barrel Behind the Door” in response to an effect that you KNOW will inflict damage to your Life Points (which is why you can’t use it in response to “Dice Jar”). Also, “Time Wizard” causes you to “lose” Life Points. Since “Barrel Behind the Door” cannot be used against such effects, you cannot use “Barrel Behind the Door” with “Time Wizard” anyway.

  <li>You don’t Normal Summon or Flip Summon “Total Defense Shogun” in Defense Position; you Normal Summon or Flip Summon him in face-up Attack Position and he changes to Defense Position. (Or you can Tribute Set him in face-down Defense Position.)</li>
  <li>You cannot chain to “Total Defense Shogun”’s effect that changes him to Defense Position when Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned. So you cannot chain “Spellbinding Circle”, etc.</li>
  <li>Do not change “Total Defense Shogun” automatically to Defense Position if he is Special Summoned, only if he is Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned.</li>
  <li>While “Total Defense Shogun” is in Defense Position, he attacks using his ATK but defends with his DEF if he is attacked. If he attacks a monster with higher ATK, but ATK lower than “Total Defense Shogun”’s DEF, “Total Defense Shogun” is still destroyed because the battle is ATK vs. ATK.</li>
  <li>“Widespread Ruin” and “Mirror Force” cannot destroy “Total Defense Shogun” if he attacks while in Defense Position, and his attack resolves as normal.</li>
  <li>If “Total Defense Shogun” in Defense Position is your only monster, and attacks, your opponent cannot activate “Mirror Force” because it will have no effect.</li>
  <li>If “Total Defense Shogun” attacks while in Attack Position, and is changed to Defense Position by “Windstorm of Etaqua”, his attack resolves as normal because he can attack while in Defense Position.</li>
  <li>If “Total Defense Shogun” is a Dragon-Type because of “D. Tribe” or “DNA Surgery”, and “Dragon Capture Jar” is in play, “Total Defense Shogun” can still attack.</li>
  <li>If you select “Total Defense Shogun” with “Dark Spirit of the Silent”, “Total Defense Shogun” changes to Attack Position even though he could attack while in Defense Position.</li>

<h4 id="tower-of-babel">TOWER OF BABEL</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You place Spell Counters on “Tower of Babel” after the Spell Card resolves.</li>
  <li>“Tower of Babel” must be active and face-up on the field before the Spell Card was activated, and when the Spell Card resolves, in order to get a Spell Counter. If you chain “Tower of Babel” to a Spell Card, you do not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card. If a Quick-Play Spell Card is chained to the activation of “Tower of Babel”, you do not get a Spell Counter for that Quick-Play Spell Card.</li>
  <li>You can move Spell Counters to “Tower of Babel” with “Pitch Black Power Stone”, but if the 4th Spell Counter is placed on “Tower of Babel” with “Pitch Black Power Stone” or “Apprentice Magician”, “Tower of Babel” is destroyed but no damage is inflicted.</li>
  <li>“Tower of Babel” cannot blow up in the middle of a chain. If you wind up with 5 Spell Counters on “Tower of Babel” after a chain resolves, the player who caused the 4th Spell Counter to be placed takes the damage. So if you have “Tower of Babel” with 3 Spell Counters, and you activate “Pot of Greed”, and your opponent chains “Reload”, “Reload” resolves first and places the 4th Spell Counter, and your opponent takes the 3000 damage after the current chain resolves.</li>
  <li>If “Mystical Space Typhoon” targets “Tower of Babel” with 3 Spell Counters, “Tower of Babel” is destroyed when “Mystical Space Typhoon” resolves, and never gets the 4th Spell Counter, so neither player takes damage.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tragedy">TRAGEDY</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot activate “Tragedy” during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Tragedy” after an Attack Position monster is changed to Defense Position by a card effect, such as “Enemy Controller” or “Stumbling”.</li>
  <li>“Spear Dragon” changes its battle position at the end of the Damage Step, so you cannot activate “Tragedy” at that time. “Goblin Attack Force” and “Giant Orc” change their battle positions at the end of the Battle Phase, so you can activate “Tragedy” at that time.</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can send a face-down “Winged Kuriboh” to the Graveyard to activate the effect of “Transcendent Wings”.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If I activate “Trap Dustshoot” when my opponent has 4 or more cards in their hand, but an effect is activated (such as chaining “Book of Moon” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”) after “Trap Dustshoot” is activated that causes them to have less than 4 cards in their hand, do I still get to see my opponent’s hand and return a monster?<br />
A: Yes. If a player has 4 cards in hand when “Trap Dustshoot” is activated and they chain a card causing them to go below the 4 card requirement you will still get the effect of “Trap Dustshoot.” For the player to successfully dodge “Trap Dustshoot” they would need to use their turn player priority to use “Book of Moon” or “Mystical Space Typhoon” BEFORE you activate “Trap Dustshoot”..</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot activate “Triangle Ecstasy Spark” if “Harpie Lady Sisters” is not on the field. You can activate it if the opponent controls a “Harpie Lady Sisters”. In that case the ATK of the opponent’s “Harpie Lady Sisters” will become 2700, but the opponent still cannot activate Trap Cards, and the effects of Trap Cards on the opponent’s side of the field are negated.</li>
  <li>If there are multiple copies of “Harpie Lady Sisters” on the field, the ATK of each becomes 2700 until the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If a Trap Card such as “Waboku” is chained to the activation of “Triangle Ecstasy Spark”, the effect of “Waboku” resolves first, and will apply for the rest of the turn regardless of “Triangle Ecstasy Spark”. (Just like if “Jinzo” is Summoned after “Waboku” is activated and resolves.)</li>

A: Correct. The Type declared when “Tribe-Infecting Virus’” effect was activated no longer exists on the field due to “DNA Surgery,” so its effect will disappear. The monster would not be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/12/2004</li>

  <li>If the first attack of a monster equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce” is negated by “Magic Cylinder”, the monster can still perform the second attack.</li>
  <li>When you declare the second attack of a monster equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce”, and the “Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce” is destroyed during the Battle Step with “Mystical Space Typhoon”, the monster is no longer capable of performing the second attack, and a replay occurs.</li>

<h4 id="twin-headed-behemoth">TWIN-HEADED BEHEMOTH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effect of this card is only activated when it is “destroyed”. It will not activate if Tributed, discarded, or sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When “Twin-Headed Behemoth” is Special Summoned by its own effect you can activate “Card of Safe Return” and draw 1 card.</li>
  <li>When “Twin-Headed Behemoth” is Special Summoned by its own effect and is equipped with “Megamorph” it is the original ATK/DEF that is doubled or halved. (ATK 3000 / DEF 2400 if doubled, ATK 750 / DEF 600 if halved)</li>
  <li>The opponent cannot activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” when “Twin-Headed Behemoth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, because its ATK is already changed to 1000 at the time of Summoning.</li>
  <li>The condition that this card’s effect can only be used once per Duel cannot be reset. So if it is Special Summoned by its own effect and later removed from play, flipped face-down, returned to your hand, destroyed and Special Summoned, or shuffled into your Deck, you STILL cannot use its effect a second time.</li>
  <li>If removed from play temporarily by the effect of “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, it will return with its original ATK/DEF, but its condition is not reset.</li>
  <li>If flipped face-down, and then Flip Summoned, it will have its original ATK/DEF, but its condition is not reset.</li>
  <li>If equipped to “Relinquished” and destroyed, you can use the effect of this card and it will be Special Summoned on your side of the field with ATK/DEF of 1000 points. (If you have not already used this effect once.)</li>
  <li>If this card is controlled by your opponent and is destroyed, it will be Special Summoned on your side of the field with ATK/DEF of 1000 points. (If you have not already used this effect once.)</li>
  <li>If “Twin-Headed Behemoth” would be Special Summoned by its own effect, but your Monster Card Zones are full, or the effect of “Scapegoat” prevents you from Summoning, it still considered that its effect was activated, and you cannot use it again in the current Duel.</li>
  <li>You may still Special Summon “Twin-Headed Behemoth” with the effect of “Monster Reborn”, etc. after its effect has been used once.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Monster Reborn” to Special Summon “Twin-Headed Behemoth” in the turn it was destroyed, its effect has not yet been used, and it will activate the next time it is destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Twin-Headed Behemoth’s” effect only trigger when it is destroyed on the field?<br />
A: Normally this happens while it is on the field, but if a card effect was to destroy it while it was in your hand or Deck and then send it to the Graveyard, the effect would be satisfied. Say, if I had my opponent’s “Twin-Headed Behemoth” in my hand from the effect of “Exchange.” I Summon it and my opponent activates “Chain Destruction.” “Chain Destruction” could destroy the copy in my Deck and send it to the Graveyard. (“Chain Destruction” includes the text of destroying the affected cards in the player’s hand and/or Deck) This is most likely never going to happen though, so I wouldn’t count on it. For the most part, the “Twin-Headed Behemoth” will be destroyed while it is on the field. Curtis Schultz, 02/02/2004</li>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ATK of “Tyranno Infinity” changes according to the current number of your Dinosaur removed from play.</li>
  <li>Remember that monsters removed from play go to the “removed zone” of the owner, even if controlled by the opponent, and even if they will return to the opponent’s side of the field later because of “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”.</li>
  <li>If “Tyranno Infinity” is equipped with “Megamorph” and the number of removed from play Dinosaurs changes, first change the original ATK of “Tyranno Infinity”, and then double or halve for “Megamorph”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tyrant-dragon">TYRANT DRAGON</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first sentence of this card’s text means that after you complete an attack with “Tyrant Dragon”, if there is still a monster on the opponent’s side of the field, “Tyrant Dragon” can immediately attack again. You cannot attack with another monster in between, and then attack a second time with “Tyrant Dragon.” If there are no monsters on your opponent’s side of the field after “Tyrant Dragon”’s first attack, “Tyrant Dragon” does not gain a second attack.</li>
  <li>“Tyrant Dragon” cannot attack more than twice, even if there is another monster remaining on your opponent’s side of the field after the second attack.</li>
  <li>“Tyrant Dragon”’s first attack does not have to be the first attack of the Battle Phase. You may attack with another monster, then with “Tyrant Dragon”, then again with “Tyrant Dragon” – if the opponent still controls a monster.</li>
  <li>Suppose you control “Tyrant Dragon” and another monster (“Dark Magician” for example), and the opponent only has 1 monster. You attack with “Tyrant Dragon” and destroy their 1 monster. Then you declare a direct attack with “Dark Magician” and the opponent activates “Scapegoat” to Special Summon 4 “Sheep Tokens”. A replay occurs, and that means “Tyrant Dragon” was the last monster to attack, so it may attack again, and attack one of the Sheep Tokens. Then you can attack with “Dark Magician”.</li>
  <li>The opponent may activate Trap Cards that target “Tyrant Dragon”, but their effects will be negated and the cards destroyed.</li>
  <li>When you Summon “Tyrant Dragon”, the opponent can activate “Torrential Tribute” or “Bottomless Trap Hole” and destroy “Tyrant Dragon” because neither of these Trap Cards target. (However, “Trap Hole” does target and its effect will disappear if activated.)</li>
  <li>When you attack with “Tyrant Dragon” the opponent can activate “Mirror Force” and all your Attack Position monsters, including “Tyrant Dragon”, will be destroyed. This is because “Mirror Force” does not target.</li>
  <li>You may activate “Last Turn” and select your “Tyrant Dragon” as the monster to keep, because “Last Turn” does not target.</li>
  <li>When you Summon “Tyrant Dragon” the opponent can activate “Solemn Judgment” or “Horn of Heaven” to negate the Summon.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Tyrant Dragon”. After it resolves, “Call of the Haunted” will be destroyed and “Tyrant Dragon” will remain on the field. You must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster to perform this Special Summon, in accordance with the text of “Tyrant Dragon”.</li>
  <li>If you activate “Monster Reborn” to Special Summon your opponent’s “Tyrant Dragon” in your opponent’s Graveyard, you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster from your side of the field. If you do not control a Dragon-Type monster, you cannot select “Tyrant Dragon” as a target for “Monster Reborn”.</li>
  <li>You Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when the effect that Special Summons “Tyrant Dragon” resolves, not when it activates. So if you activate “Monster Reborn” and target “Tyrant Dragon” and your opponent chains “Imperial Order” and negates “Monster Reborn” you do not Tribute a Dragon-Type monster. Likewise, if you control 1 Dragon-Type monster on the field, and activate “Monster Reborn”, and your opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” to destroy your only Dragon-Type monster, you are unable to Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when “Monster Reborn” resolves and its effect disappears.</li>
  <li>You may Tribute a face-down Dragon-Type monster when you Special Summon “Tyrant Dragon”.</li>
  <li>Even if “Tyrant Dragon” was destroyed by “Dark Balter the Terrible” or some other monster that negated the effect of “Tyrant Dragon”, you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster if you Special Summon it because this is a condition, not an effect.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Q: If I declare an attack and my opponent uses the effect of “Ultimate Offering” to tribute the monster I am attacking for a higher level monster, does my attack continue?<br />
A: A replay would occur because the target of your attack is no longer on the field. Play will return to the Battle Step. You are not forced to attack the new monster. Curtis Schultz, 12/08/2003</li>
  <li>Q: If a player has an active “Ultimate Offering” on the field, can their opponent use the effect?<br />
A: Only the controller of “Ultimate Offering” can use its effect. Curtis Schultz, 02/13/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Can “Ultimate Offering” chain to itself?<br />
A: Yes, it can. bishop 02/23/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Can you use the Spell or Trap cards brought to the field through the effect of “Magical Hats” as a Tribute using Ultimate Offering?<br />
A: Yes, you can offer the face-down non-monster cards selected from the effect of “Magicial Hats” as Tributes for a Tribute Summon using “Ultimate Offering.” The non-monster cards are being treated as monsters during that Battle Phase, so it will okay to do this. You would need to resolve “Magical Hats” first in order to get the non-monster cards into play, then activate the effect of “Ultimate Offering” afterwards. Curtis Schultz, 02/02/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If an Effect Monster such as “Sonic Bird” is summoned by the effect of “Ultimate Offering” during the opponent’s Battle Phase, will the effect of the monster still activate?<br />
A: The Summon performed by “Ultimate Offering” during the opponent’s Battle Phase is still considered a Normal Summon… So if you choose to use its effect and Summon a “Sonic Bird,” the “Sonic Bird’s” effect will after it is successfully Summoned. Obviously this will not happen if you were to Set the “Sonic Bird.” Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004</li>

  <li>When you Special Summon “Vampire Lord” with his effect, your opponent can negate the Special Summon with “Royal Oppression”, but the “Vampire Lord” will have been destroyed by your opponent’s card effect (“Royal Oppression”) and will be Special Summoned again during your next Standby Phase.</li>

  <li>When your opponent doesn’t have the type of card that you declared for “Vampire Lord”, the effect of “Vampire Lord” disappears but you get to look at your opponent’s Deck to confirm it.</li>
  <li>It is the controller of “Vampire Lord”, not necessarily the owner, that names a card type.</li>

<h4 id="waboku">WABOKU</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Waboku” makes Battle Damage dealt by your opponent’s monsters to your monsters and to your Life Points become zero.</li>
  <li>“Waboku” applies to ALL of the monsters on that player’s side of the field for the entire turn.</li>
  <li>To illustrate how “Waboku” works, here are some scenarios and their results:</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 1: Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” attacks Player B’s “Mega Thunderball”, and Player B activates “Waboku”. RESULT: Player A’s (attacking) “Mega Thunderball” is destroyed. Player B’s “Mega Thunderball” (with equal ATK) is NOT destroyed.</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 2: Player A activates “Waboku”. Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” then attacks Player B’s “Mega Thunderball”. RESULT: Player B’s “Mega Thunderball” is destroyed. Player A’s (attacking) “Mega Thunderball” is NOT destroyed. So you can use “Waboku” “offensively” when attacking an equal ATK monster.</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 3: Player A activates “Waboku”. Player A’s “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” then attacks Player B’s “Sanga of the Thunder”. Player B uses “Sanga of the Thunder”’s effect (during the Damage Step). RESULT: Player A’s “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” (ATK 0) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any Life Points, because of Player A’s “Waboku”.</li>
  <li>SCENARIO 4: Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” attacks Player B’s “Mega Thunderball”. Player B activates “Fairy Box” or “Mirror Wall”. Player A activates “Waboku”. RESULT: Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” (with reduced ATK) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any life points, because of Player A’s “Waboku”. But because Player A’s “Mega Thunderball” had reduced ATK, Player B’s “Mega Thunderball” is not destroyed either.</li>

  <li>“Waboku” does not alter ATK value.</li>
  <li>If a monster protected by “Waboku” is attacked by or attacks a monster with the same ATK value that is not protected by “Waboku,” the other monster is destroyed in battle as normal.</li>
  <li>Face-down monsters attacked while protected by “Waboku” will still flip face up.</li>

<h4 id="wave-motion-cannon">WAVE-MOTION CANNON</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sending “Wave-Motion Cannon” to the Graveyard is a cost, so when you send it to the Graveyard, it’s too late for your opponent to chain “Mystical Space Typhoon”, etc., to destroy “Wave-Motion Cannon”, because “Wave-Motion Cannon” is already in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>Your opponent cannot chain “Magic Jammer”, or use “Dark Paladin”, etc., when you send “Wave-Motion Cannon” from the field to the Graveyard. Your opponent CAN chain “Magic Jammer” or use “Dark Paladin”, etc., when you first activate “Wave-Motion Cannon” (meaning when you place it face-up on the field).</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” is active on the field, count Standby Phases as normal for “Wave-Motion Cannon”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Wave-Motion Cannon” (place it face-up on the field) and send it to the Graveyard during the same turn, but it will not do any damage.</li>
  <li>If the Standby Phase is skipped with “Solomon’s Lawbook” or the turn is skipped with “Gamble”, increase the count for “Wave-Motion Cannon” anyway.</li>
  <li>You cannot use “Pyro Clock of Destiny” with “Wave-Motion Cannon”.</li>

</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: During Main Phase 1, can “Wave-Motion Cannon” be sent to the Graveyard for its effect prior to the opponent attempting to destroy it with a Set “Mystical Space Typhoon”?<br />
A: As the turn player you could claim priority and send the “Wave Motion Cannon” to the Graveyard, to which the opponent can then respond. This would not be true if you were to activate another card’s effect during your Main Phase 1 first, like “Raigeki” for example, since they could then respond with their “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain to “Raigeki” and destroy the “Wave Motion Cannon” in the chain. The opponent would need to destroy your “Wave Motion Cannon” during your Standby Phase. Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If a “Wave-Motion Cannon” is on my field and I activate “Imperial Order” does it still get its counter during my Standby phase.<br />
A: “Wave-Motion Cannon” does not use Counters. If “Imperial Order” is on the field, “Wave-Motion Cannon” will still get its phase count, but it does not use physical counters like other spell cards do. bishop, 12/07/2003</li>
  <li>Q: If “Imperial Order” were active after “Wave-Motion Cannon” was activated, when “Imperial Order” leaves play, does the turn count return to 0?<br />

  <li>If “Weapon Change” is removed from the field by “Giant Trunade” or “Emergency Provisions”, “Weapon Change”’s effect is not applied.</li>
  <li>If “Imperial Order” is activated after “Weapon Change”, “Weapon Change”’s effect is negated, but if “Imperial Order” is destroyed, then “Weapon Change”’s effect is re-applied.</li>

<h4 id="wicked-breaking-flamberge---baou">WICKED-BREAKING FLAMBERGE - BAOU</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sending 1 card to the Graveyard is a cost. This is not “discarding” so it doesn’t trigger “Forced Requisition”, and you can pay the cost even if “Goblin of Greed” is in play.</li>
  <li>If a monster equipped with “Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou” attacks and destroys “Amazoness Fighter” or “Amazoness Swordswoman”, their effects are not negated because they happen during damage calculation, before they are determined to have been destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Wicked-Breaking Flamberge – Baou” permanently disable monster effects such as “Sinister Serpent?” Or are there some kind of limits as to how long its effect lasts on the monster?<br />
A: It would work just like the effect of “Dark Ruler Ha Des.” Curtis Schultz, 01/14/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Does “Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou” negate Flip Effects of destroyed monsters, or just “Sangan”, “Mystic Tomato”, and “Dark Necrofear” type cards?<br />
A: A monster equipped with “Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou” will negate the effect of any monster it destroys. This includes Flip Effect monsters, because Flip Effects are not applied until AFTER damage calculation (at which point a monster has already been determined to either remain on the field or be destroyed from battle).

<h4 id="winged-kuriboh">WINGED KURIBOH</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed as a result of battle, its effect will not reduce the Battle Damage its owner takes from that battle, because its effect doesn’t activate until later, when it’s sent to the Graveyard. (And damage calculation has already happened by then.)</li>
  <li>If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates and applies for the rest of the turn, even if “Winged Kuriboh” is removed from play with “Disappear”, or shuffled back into the Deck with “Fiber Jar”.</li>
  <li>Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it will not be negated by “Skill Drain” but it will be negated by “The End of Anubis”.</li>
  <li>Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it is the original owner that will get the effect. So if the opponent took control with “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal”, if it is destroyed then it goes to the original owner’s Graveyard and they get the effect.</li>
  <li>When “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, the activation of its effect can be chained to.</li>
  <li>After the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” resolves, the application of the effect (making Battle Damage zero) does not start a chain and cannot be chained to.</li>
  <li>If “Winged Kuriboh” is treated as an Equip Card (like if it’s equipped to “Relinquished”) and it’s destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect still activates.</li>
  <li>If your opponent takes control of your “Winged Kuriboh” and when it tries to return to your control you have no open Monster Card Zones, “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, and its effect activates.</li>

<h4 id="winged-kuriboh-lv10">WINGED KURIBOH LV10</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Winged Kuriboh LV10” has a Multi-Trigger Effect. You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.</li>
  <li>The Multi-Trigger Effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”can be chained to. You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” or “My Body as a Shield” to the effect.</li>
  <li>Tributing “Winged Kuriboh LV10” is a cost to activate its effect.</li>
  <li>The “combined original ATK” of the destroyed monsters is calculated after the monsters are destroyed and are no longer on the field. So a destroyed “King of the Skull Servants” would add 0 damage to this effect, and a destroyed “Fusilier Dragon – the Dual Mode Beast” that was Summoned without Tribute would add 2800 damage.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Level Up!” to send “Winged Kuriboh LV10” to the Graveyard because it does not have a monster’s name in its text.</li>
  <li>You may return “Winged Kuriboh LV10” from your Graveyard to your Deck with the effect of “The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension”.</li>
  <li>If an opponent’s monster cannot be destroyed by the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”, no damage is dealt for that monster’s ATK. For example, if “Master Monk” targeted by “Lone Wolf” is on the field, it is unaffected by monster effects, so it will not be destroyed and its 1900 original ATK points will not be inflicted to its controller.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10” if “Skill Drain” is on the field, and its effect will resolve normally and not be negated, because it is no longer a face-up monster on the field.</li>

<h4 id="woodland-sprite">WOODLAND SPRITE</h4>

<p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Woodland Sprite” gives you the ability to send Equip Spell Cards equipped to it to the Graveyard. Sending them to the Graveyard for this specific purpose is the only way to activate the effect and inflict 500 points of damage to your opponent.</li>
  <li>This card’s effect can only be activated during your Main Phase, but may be activated more than once per turn.</li>
  <li>An Equip Spell Card sent to the Graveyard by this card’s effect is not “destroyed”. So the effects of “Butterfly Dagger – Elma”, “Axe of Despair”, “Malevolent Nuzzler”, “Blast with Chain”, or “Smoke Grenade of the Thief” cannot or will not be activated.</li>
  <li>If you send “Black Pendant” to the Graveyard with this card’s effect, the effect of “Black Pendant” will activate, because it does not have to be “destroyed”, just sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Premature Burial” to Special Summon “Woodland Sprite” from your Graveyard, and then its effect to send “Premature Burial” to the Graveyard and “Woodland Sprite” will remain on the field. This is because “Premature Burial” was not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you opponent activates “Snatch Steal” and equips it to your “Woodland Sprite”, they may choose to activate its effect and send “Snatch Steal” to the Graveyard. You will take 500 damage, and then control of “Woodland Sprite” would return to you.</li>

  <li>If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.</li>
  <li>If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.</li>
  <li>If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.</li>
  <li>If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.</li>

A: They would need to be monsters at the time you would remove them from play to Special Summon the associated XYZ Fusion monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If “X-Head Cannon”, “Y-Dragon Head”, and “Z-Metal Tank” are used to attack the opponent, can they be removed from play to Special Summon “XYZ-Dragon Cannon” during the Battle Phase to attack the opponent once again?<br />

<ul>
  <li>Q: If the player that controls “Yata-Garasu” repeatedly attacks his/her opponent’s Life Points to inflict Battle Damage over a period of so many turns and/or until his/her opponent’s Life Points reaches 0, will it be considered “stalling”?<br />
A: Playing out the “Yata-Garasu” effect is NOT considered stalling. However, your opponent must be allowed to concede if he/she chooses and there is no foreseeable manner to avoid a game loss. But there should not be any coercion on either player’s part to sit through the effect multiple times or to be forced to play it out needlessly. bishop, 02/01/2004</li>

  <li>“Zombyra the Dark” equipped with “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” may not attack directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: Will “Zombyra the Dark’s” attack decrease from the modified ATK caused by “Adhesion Trap Hole” (1050), or will it decrease from the original ATK (2100) and then the effect from “Adhesion Trap Hole” take effect each time it destroys a monster. i.e., “Zombyra the Dark” destroys a monster. Is its ATK now 850 or 950?<br />
A: “Adhesion Trap Hole” will only cause the original ATK of the monster to be halved. So in “Zombyra the Dark’s” case, “Adhesion Trap Hole” will cause it to be at 1050 ATK after being summoned. Then, “Zombyra the Dark’s” effect will cause it to lose 200 ATK points each time it destroys a monster. After destroying 1 monster, “Zombyra the Dark’s” ATK value will be 850.

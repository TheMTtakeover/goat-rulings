## Card Rulings

#### 3-HUMP LACOODA

*(1) If there are 3 face-up "3-Hump Lacooda" cards on your side of the field, Tribute 2 of them to draw 3 cards.*

- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
- You don't have to activate "3-Hump Lacooda"'s effect just because you have 3 copies in play.
- You can choose which of the "3-Hump Lacoodas"' effects you are activating;  it can be one of the ones you are Tributing or the one that is remaining on the field.
- Tributing 2 "3-Hump Lacoodas" is a cost.
- If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" or "Book of Moon" to the  activation of "3-Hump Lacooda"'s effect, the effect is not negated.
- If you Summon your third "3-Hump Lacooda", you can activate its effect before your opponent activates "Torrential Tribute".


#### 7

*When there are 3 face-up "7" cards on your side of the field, draw 3 cards  from your Deck. Then destroy all "7" cards. When this card is sent  directly from the field to your Graveyard, increase your Life Points by  700 points.*

- If you have 3 "7"'s and destroy them all, you get 2100 Life Points.
- If your opponent also has "7"'s, they are also destroyed.
- If you have 3 "7"'s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain "Imperial Order" to negate the effect.
- Each effect of "7" that gives you 700 Life Points goes on a chain, so if  multiple "7"'s are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the chain.
- If other cards are also sent to the  Graveyard at the same time, like "Sangan" or "Black Pendant", the card  controlled by the turn player is Step 1.
- If your 3rd "7" is  activated, but destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon" in a chain, you  can't activate its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its  Graveyard effect.


#### 8-CLAWS SCORPION

*(1) Once per turn, you can flip this card into face-down Defense Position.  (2) When this card attacks an opponent's face-down Defense Position  monster, this card's ATK becomes 2400 during damage calculation only.*

- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - If you use this effect, then Flip Summon this card: you cannot used this effect again that turn [[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-flip-flop-fundamentals)].
- The (2) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect is applied if the condition is correct on activation ("8-Claws  Scorpion" declared an attack against a face-down Defense Position  monster.) The target monster does not have to be in face-down Defense  Position when the effect of "8-Claws Scorpion" is resolved. So if "Final Attack Orders" is active, or "Ceasefire" flips the monster face-up,  "8-Claws Scorpion" still gets its 2400 ATK.
  - The ATK of "8-Claws  Scorpion" becomes 2400 during damage calculation. You cannot chain "Rush Recklessly" or "Blast with Chain" to this effect. If these cards were  activated before damage calculation, then the ATK of "8-Claws Scorpion"  becomes 2400 during damage calculation so those cards have no effect on  its ATK.
  - Even if "8-Claws Scorpion" is equipped with an Equip  Spell Card, its ATK is 2400 when it attacks a face-down Defense Position monster.


#### A CAT OF ILL OMEN

*FLIP: Select 1 Trap Card from your Deck and place it on top of your Deck. If  "Necrovalley" is on the field, you can add the selected Trap Card to  your hand instead.*

- Show the card to your opponent.
- If "Imperial Order" & "Necrovalley" are both active, and "A Cat of Ill Omen" is flipped, you add the card to your hand because "Necrovalley"  is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.
- If  "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained to the effect to destroy  "Necrovalley", so that "Necrovalley" is not on the field when this  effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.
- You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.


#### 'A' CELL BREEDING DEVICE

*(1) During each of your Standby Phases, put 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - You can select a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards  as the monster to put an A-Counter on, but the counter will not be  placed.


#### 'A' CELL INCUBATOR

*(1) Each time an A-Counter(s) is removed from play by a card effect, place 1 A-Counter on this card. (2) When this card is destroyed, distribute the A-Counters on this card among face-up monsters.*

- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
  - This effect does not use the Chain.
  - If an A-Counter is removed to pay a cost, an A-Counter is placed upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
  - If an A-Counter on this card is removed by an effect, place an A-Counter upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
  - The effect of “’A’ Cell Incubator” is not applied when A-Counters are  removed because the card with the A-Counters was removed from the field  or flipped face-down, because these A-Counters are not removed by an  effect.
- The (2) mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
  - You may place A-Counters on face-up monsters on either field.


#### 'A' CELL SCATTER BURST

*Select 1 face-up "Alien" monster you control. Destroy it and distribute new  A-Counters equal to its Level among your opponent's face-up monsters.*

- This effect targets 1 face-up “Alien” monster you control.
- You choose which monsters to put the A-Counters on when this effect resolves.
- You can distribute the A-Counters however you wish among your opponent’s face-up monsters.
- You must place exactly as many A-Counters as the Level of the monster targeted by this effect.
- You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls no face-up monsters.


#### A DEAL WITH DARK RULER

*You can only activate this card during a turn in which a Level 8 or higher  monster on your side of the field was sent to the Graveyard. Special  Summon 1 "Berserk Dragon" from your hand or Deck.*

- The "Level" in "A Deal with Dark Ruler" is the original Level printed on the Monster Card.
- If your opponent's Level 8 or higher monster than you control is sent to  the Graveyard, you can activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler".
- You cannot activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler" during the Damage Step.
- You can only Special Summon 1 monster with "A Deal with Dark Ruler", but  you can activate 2 copies of "A Deal with Dark Ruler" to Special Summon 1 "Berserk Dragon" for each, even if only 1 Level 8 or higher monster was sent to the Graveyard.
- You can activate "A Deal with Dark  Ruler" if your Level 8 or higher monster that is an Equip Spell Card is  sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard (such as "Koitsu" or  "Dark Necrofear" destroyed by "Heavy Storm").


#### A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX

*Discard 1 card. Select 1 card from your Graveyard and return it to the top of your Deck.*

- Discarding 1 card is a cost. Your opponent can chain "D.D. Crow".
- This is an effect that targets.
- You can target a Fusion / Synchro Monster in the Graveyard, but it is returned to the Extra Deck.
- You can target the card you discarded for the cost of "A Feather of the  Phoenix" to be the card returned to the top of your Deck. If you  discarded "Night Assailant" or "Makyura the Destructor", then their  effects will activate.


#### A FEINT PLAN

*A player cannot attack face-down monsters during this turn.*

- If "A Feint Plan" is activated and you control only face-down monsters,  your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack  your Life Points directly either.

- If you activate "A  Feint Plan" after your opponent declares an attack against one of your  face-down monsters, that attack resolves as normal, but they cannot  attack other face-down monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is  because "A Feint Plan" prevents declaring an attack against a face-down  monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time "A Feint  Plan" resolves during the Battle Step.)


#### A HERO EMERGES

*You can only activate this card when your opponent declares an attack. Your opponent selects 1 random card from your hand. If it is a Monster Card, Special Summon it on your side of the field. If not, send it to the  Graveyard.*

- You can Special Summon a high-level monster, like "Dark Magician", with "A Hero Emerges". But if your opponent selects a  Special Summon-only monster like "Dark Necrofear", or a Spirit Monster,  it is sent to the Graveyard.

- When "Guardian Elma" is  selected for "A Hero Emerges", and you have "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field, you can Special Summon her, but if you don't  have it, then she is sent to the Graveyard.

- You can activate "A Hero Emerges" even if you have only 1 card in your hand.


#### A LEGENDARY OCEAN

*(C) This card's name is treated as "Umi". (1) Reduce the Level of all WATER monsters in both players' hands and on the field by 1. (2) All WATER monsters gain 200 ATK and DEF.*

- The (C) Condition cannot be negated, it applies in the Deck:
  - You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between "A Legendary Ocean" and  "Umi", because this card’s name is treated as "Umi". So you cannot have 3 copies of "Umi" and 3 copies of "A Legendary Ocean" in your Deck.
  - The name of "A Legendary Ocean" is treated as "Umi" always and for all  purposes. If "Imperial Order" is active, the card name is still treated  as "Umi". If the opponent activates "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell" targeting "Umi", you cannot activate "Umi" or "A Legendary Ocean" for  the rest of the Duel.
  - When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may activate "Tornado Wall".
- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER  Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4  monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show  your opponent.
  - When the effect of "Cyber Jar" is activated and  "A Legendary Ocean" is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5  WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of "Cyber Jar". This is because  the effect of "A Legendary Ocean" does not include Monster Cards in the  Deck.
  - If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Gravity Bind" are active, you  may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If "A Legendary Ocean" is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay  occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.
  - If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Infinite Dismissal" are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be  destroyed during the End Phase.
- The (2) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, "The Legendary Fisherman" on the field  is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus  or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your  hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.
  - "A Legendary Ocean" does not have the effect of "Umi" that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.


#### A MAN WITH WDJAT

*(1) When you Normal Summon this card, and during each of your Standby  Phases, select 1 Set card on your opponent's side of the field. Pick it  up and look at it, then return it to its original position.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
- If you Set "A Man with Wdjat", its effect is not activated.

- Any effects of the card you look at are not activated when you look at them with "A Man with Wdjat" (such as a Flip Effect, or if it is a Trap  Card, etc.).

#### A RIVAL APPEARS!

*Select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Special Summon 1 monster from your hand that has the same Level as the selected monster.*

- For the effect of “A Rival Appears!”, refer to the levels of the monster on the field and the monster in the hand at the time “A Rival Appears!”  resolves (for purposes of “Cost Down”, “Level Conversion Lab”, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain destroying “Demotion”, etc.)

- If the opponent’s monster is face-down or not on the field when “A Rival Appears!” resolves, then its effect disappears.

- If you do not have a monster of the same level as the target, you cannot activate “A Rival Appears!”

#### A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON

*Return 1 face-up Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster you control to the owner's hand and destroy all Spell and Trap Cards.*

- "A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon" targets 1 Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster.

- If you target a Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type Fusion / Synchro Monster, it is returned to the Extra Deck.

- If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field / has its Monster  Type changed, "A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon's" effect disappears.

#### ABARE USHIONI

*(1) Once per turn, you can toss a coin and call it. If you call it right,  inflict 1000 damage to your opponent. If you call it wrong, you take  1000 damage.*

- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
- If you call the coin toss wrong for “Abare Ushioni” you can still prevent the damage with “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, etc.

- You cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the effect of “Abare Ushioni”  because you don’t know yet if you will take damage or not from the  effect.

#### ABSOLUTE END

*Activate only during your opponent's turn. This turn, the attacks from your opponent's monsters become direct attacks.*

- When "Absolute End" is activated during an attack, that attack becomes a direct attack.

- If "Taunt" and "Absolute End" are both active, the attack becomes a direct attack to your Life Points. This is because the attack target is the  monster selected by "Taunt", but then "Absolute End" turns it into a  direct attack.

#### ABSORBING KID FROM THE SKY

*(1) When this card destroys a monster and sends it to the Graveyard as a  result of battle, increase your Life Points by the Level of the  destroyed monster x 300 points.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - This card must be face-up on the field to activate this effect [[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-will-it-trigger)].
  - The Level is the original Level printed on the card.

#### ABYSSAL DESIGNATOR

*Pay 1000 Life Points. Declare a Type and an Attribute. Your opponent must  send 1 monster with both the declared Type and Attribute from their hand or Deck to the Graveyard.*

- If your opponent sends a monster  to the Graveyard with the declared Type and Attribute, you cannot see  their hand and Deck. But if they claim to have no such card, you can  check their hand and Deck to confirm.

#### ACID TRAP HOLE

*Select 1 face-down Defense Position monster. Flip it face-up, and if the DEF  of the monster is 2000 points or less, destroy the monster. If the DEF  is more than 2000 points, return the monster to face-down Defense  Position.*

- A face-down "Jinzo" will be destroyed by this card.

- If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as "Enraged Muka Muka", calculate the current DEF, then determine if it  will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in  your hand, "Enraged Muka Muka" would not be destroyed.

- If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated  whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected  monster is 2000 or less, such as a "Hane-Hane", it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.

#### ADHESION TRAP HOLE

*Activate only when your opponent Summons a monster(s). While that monster(s) is  face-up on the field, its original ATK is halved.*

- "Adhesion Trap Hole" works against "a monster or monsters", so "Adhesion Trap Hole" does NOT target.

- When "Cyber Jar" is activated, you may use "Adhesion Trap Hole" against all  monsters your opponent Special Summons in face-up Attack Position, but  "Adhesion Trap Hole" has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons face-down.
- "Adhesion Trap Hole" cannot affect monsters Special Summoned face-down with "The Shallow Grave", "Morphing Jar #2", etc.
- If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is flipped face-down (with  "Book of Moon", etc.), "Adhesion Trap Hole"'s effect disappears and the  monster's ATK is back to normal.
- "Adhesion Trap Hole" halves the original ATK, so if you activate another effect that alters ATK, halve  the original ATK first and then resolve the other ATK-modifying effect.

- If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is then equipped with "Megamorph", only "Megamorph"'s effect applies.

#### ADHESIVE EXPLOSIVE

*(1) If an opponent's monster attacks this face-down Defense Position card,  this card becomes an Equip Card equipped to the attacking monster,  without applying damage calculation. (2) Destroy the equipped monster  during the Standby Phase of your opponent's next turn.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 3 - Before Damage Calculation.
  - If “Mystic Swordsman LV2” attacks, its effect will not activate.
  - If “Drillroid” attacks it, its effect will activate.
  - If this face-down card is attacked by “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6”  or “Guardian Kay’est”, it will still be equipped to the attacker, but it will not destroy the equipped monster during the Standby Phase.
- The (2) Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
  - This effect is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card.

#### ADVANCE DRAW

*Tribute 1 face-up Level 8 or higher monster you control. Draw 2 cards.*

- Tributing 1 face-up Level 8 or higher monster is a cost.

#### ADVANCE FORCE

*(1) You can Tribute 1 Level 5 or higher monster to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher monster.*

- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
  - You can still Tribute 2 monsters to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher monster if you want to.
  - Only the controller of “Advance Force” gets the effect.

#### ADVANCED RITUAL ART

*Select 1 Ritual Monster in your hand. Send Normal Monsters from your Deck to  the Graveyard whose total Levels are equal to that Ritual Monster's.  Ritual Summon a card with the name of the selected Ritual Monster from  your hand.*

- This effect does not target anything.

- You choose the Ritual Monster you want to Ritual Summon when the effect resolves.
- You send the Normal Monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard when the effect resolves.

#### AEGIS OF THE OCEAN DRAGON LORD

*Until the End Phase of this turn, face-up Level 3 or lower WATER monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle or by card effects.*

- You can still activate this card even if you control no face-up Level 3 or lower WATER monsters at the time.
- This effect is applied until you choose to end it during the End Phase.
- This effect applies to all Level 3 or lower WATER monsters you control, even ones that you Summon after this card’s resolution.

#### AFTER GENOCIDE

*This card can only be activated during Main Phase 1. All monsters on both  sides of the field that have been involved in damage calculation are  destroyed during the End Step of the turn.*

- This card's title has been changed to "After the Struggle". If you have a card titled  "After Genocide" its name is treated as "After the Struggle".

- Even if the Battle Damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku",  "Kuriboh", "Sanga of the Thunder", etc., both the attacking and  defending monster are still destroyed during the End Step by this card’s effect.
- If you activate "After the Struggle", even a monster  that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect  during the End Step.

- Note that "After the Struggle" will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.

#### AFTER THE STRUGGLE

*This card can only be activated during Main Phase 1. All monsters on both  sides of the field that have been involved in damage calculation are  destroyed during the End Step of the turn.*

- This card's title has been changed to "After the Struggle". If you have a card titled  "After Genocide" its name is treated as "After the Struggle".

- If you activate "After the Struggle", even a monster  that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect  during the End Step.

- Note that "After the Struggle" will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.

#### AGAINST THE WIND

*Select 1 "Blackwing" monster in your Graveyard. Take damage equal to the ATK of the selected monster, and add it to your hand.*

- “Against the Wind” targets 1 “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard.
- If you control “Des Wombat,” you can activate “Against the Wind,” but  since the damage you take becomes 0, you cannot add a card to your hand.
- If an effect is chained that removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard, you take no damage and do not add it to your hand.
- The effects of “Against the Wind” to inflict damage and add a card to your  hand are considered to be simultaneous, although as a practical matter  you take the damage first.
  - This means that you can activate effects like “Numinous Healer” without missing the timing.

#### AGIDO

*(1) When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of  battle, roll a six-sided die. You can Special Summon 1 Fairy-Type  monster from your Graveyard whose Level is equal to the number rolled.  (If the result is 6, you can Special Summon a Level 6 or higher  monster.)*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - "Agido" can Special Summon itself.
  - This effect does not target.

#### AIRKNIGHT PARSHATH

*(1) During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position  monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the  difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. (2) When this card  inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, draw 1 card.*

  - This effect will not apply if "Total Defense Shogun" attacks this card from Defense Position.
- The (2) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
  - Drawing a card is not optional. You must draw 1 card any time "Airknight  Parshath" inflicts Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points. This  includes direct attacks, and when it battles with a monster with a lower ATK or DEF.
  - If the opponent activates "Waboku" or "Kuriboh" to reduce the Battle Damage to 0, you do not draw.
  - When "Airknight Parshath" attacks a face-down monster with a Flip Effect and inflicts Battle Damage, you draw 1 card before the Flip Effect is  activated (in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects).

#### ALCHEMY CYCLE

*The original ATK of all face-up monsters you control becomes 0, until the  End Phase. Each time a monster that had its original ATK reduced to 0 by this effect is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1  card.*

- Monsters with an original ATK that is already 0 are  not affected by "Alchemy Cycle". You will not draw a card when they are  destroyed by battle.

- The effect to draw 1 card starts a Chain.

- Monsters Summoned or flipped face-up after "Alchemy Cycle" resolves will not have their original ATK become 0.

#### ALIEN AMMONITE

*(1) When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or  lower "Alien" monster from your Graveyard. Destroy it during the End  Phase.*

- The (1) optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing.

- You can take control of Reptile-Type monsters with this card.
  - If you control your opponent’s Reptile-Type monster and it is destroyed  and sent to their Graveyard you can activate “Alien Brain.”

#### ALIEN GREY

*FLIP: Place 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the  field. ((1) If a monster with an A-Counter battles an "Alien" monster,  it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation  only.) (2) After this card has been flipped face-up, when it is  destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1 card.*

- The Flip Effect is mandatory.
- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - If this card is not on the field, a monster with an A-Counter won't lose ATK when battling an "Alien".
  - If 2 "Alien Grey" (or other monsters with the A-Counter text) are on the  field, then a monster with 1 A-Counter will lose 600 ATK while battling  an "Alien".
- The (2) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
  - The effect to draw a card when "Alien Grey" has been flipped face-up is  activated even if it had been flipped face-up earlier in the Duel  (including Flip Summoned or being changed face-up by a card effect). It  does not have to be flipped face-up as a result of the battle that  destroyed it.

#### ALIEN HUNTER

*(1) If this card destroys a monster with an A-Counter by battle, it can attack once again in a row.*

- The (1) optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - You can also end the Battle Phase without attacking again by this effect.
- "Alien Hunter" does not have the A-Counter ATK reduction effect. So if it is  the only "Alien" you control, and it battles a monster with an  A-Counter, that opposing monster will NOT lose 300 ATK.

#### ALIEN HYPNO

*(U) This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or  in the Graveyard. (C) While this card is face-up on the field, you can  Normal Summon it to have it be treated as an Effect Monster with this  effect:*
*● (1) During your Main Phase, you can select 1  monster your opponent controls with an A-Counter(s), and take control of it while this card is on the field.

- The (1) Ignition Effect can be activated multiple times during the same turn.
  - This effect targets the selected monster, both when the monster is selected  and as long as the selected monster remains on the field.
  - If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and “Skill  Drain” is activated, control of the selected monster is returned to the  opponent. If “Skill Drain” is later negated or removed from the field,  the selected monster is returned to your control.
  - If you take  control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and afterwards  “Alien Hypno” is flipped face-down, every monster that you are  controlling with “Alien Hypno’s” effect is returned to your opponent.
  - If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and  afterwards the selected monster is flipped face-down, the selected  monster is returned to your opponent.
- The (2) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up AND treated as an Effect Monster.

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - This effect does not retroactively place A-Counters on Special Summoned monsters.

  - If "Alien  Kid" is face-up on the field when multiple monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously, then each Special Summoned monster gains one A-Counter.

*You can activate this card when your opponent declares an attack and if  there is a monster(s) on your side of the field that includes  "Amazoness" in its card name, or is named "Amazon Archer". All monsters  on your opponent's side of the field are changed to face-up Attack  Position (Flip Effects are not activated), and as long as they remain  face-up on the field, their ATK(s) are decreased by 500 points. Your  opponent must attack with all of his/her monsters.*

- "These  monsters" means all of your opponent's face-up monsters on the field at  the time "Amazoness Archers" resolves, not just the monsters that were  flipped by "Amazoness Archers"' effect.

- If you activate "Amazoness Archers" during the Battle Phase and your opponent Special  Summons another monster afterwards (such as with "Call of the Haunted",  or if "Cyber Jar" is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not  affected by "Amazoness Archers" and does not suffer the -500 ATK  reduction nor does it have to attack.
- The -500 ATK applies to  each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You  can activate multiple "Amazoness Archers" and the ATK reductions are  cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies).
- "Amazoness Archers" vs. "Cat's Ear Tribe": the ATK is 200.
- If "Fushioh Richie" or "Otohime" are flipped face-up by "Amazoness  Archers' effect, their effects are activated because their effects are  not Flip Effects; their effects begin a new chain that resolves after  the current chain.
- If a face-down "Jinzo" is flipped by "Amazoness Archers", "Amazoness Archers"' effect is not negated.
- The effect of "Amazoness Archers" will make your opponent have to attack  with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the  field. If "Amazoness Archers" is in effect, and later a replay occurs,  your opponent cannot choose not to attack.
- Monsters that have  already attacked cannot attack again. If "The Dark Door" is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot  attack still cannot attack (Toon Monsters the turn they are Summoned,  "Ultimate Obedient Fiend" under the wrong conditions, etc.) If  "Diffusion Wave-Motion" is in effect, only the monster affected by  "Diffusion Wave-Motion" can attack. The ATK reduction of "Amazoness  Archers" is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack.
- If you activate "Amazoness Archers" and chain "Magic Cylinder", "Magic  Cylinder" does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your  opponent's other monsters must attack normally. If you chain "Amazoness  Archers" to "Magic Cylinder", the ATK is reduced first and then "Magic  Cylinder" does damage.

- If either player chains "Negate Attack" to "Amazoness Archers", the Battle Phase ends because of "Negate Attack"'s effect.

  - This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
  - When a monster selected for "Amazoness Blowpiper"'s effect is flipped face-down, the effect is reset.

  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - If you get your opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master” and it’s  placed on the field, and later returned to the hand with “Penguin  Soldier”, it returns to the original owner’s hand.
  - You cannot activate the effect of “Amazoness Chain Master” if your opponent has no hand.
  - If you have your opponent’s monster that you acquired with “Amazoness  Chain Master”, and your opponent activates “Disturbance Strategy”, the  monster returns to the owner’s Deck. However, you draw the same number  of cards that you had in your hand, including 1 card for the monster you acquired with “Amazoness Chain Master”.
  - If you acquired your  opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master”, and “Remove  Brainwashing” is activated, the monster returns to the original owner if it is on the field. However, if it’s still in your hand then it is not  returned.
  - If you acquire your opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master” and your opponent uses “Lightforce Sword” on it, it  returns to your hand (not the owner’s hand) after the effect of  “Lightforce Sword” expires.

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
- "Amazoness Paladin" counts herself in her effect, so even by herself she gains +100 ATK.

#### AMAZONESS SPELLCASTER

*Until the end of this turn, switch the original ATK of 1 face-up monster on  your side of field that includes "Amazoness" in its card name or is  named "Amazon Archer", with the original ATK of 1 face-up monster on  your opponent's side of the field.*

- "Amazoness Spellcaster"  targets (it targets 2 monsters), so when you activate "Amazoness  Spellcaster" you select 1 face-up Amazoness on your side of the field  and 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field.

- You can select "Gradius' Option" as the other monster, and the original ATK of the Amazoness will now be the ATK of "Gradius' Option" at the time  "Amazoness Spellcaster" resolves. The ATK of "Gradius' Option" remains  as the ATK of "Gradius" and does not become the ATK of the Amazoness.
- If you activate "Amazoness Spellcaster", and chain "Dramatic Rescue", "Amazoness Spellcaster"'s effect disappears.
- If you switch ATKs with "Amazoness Spellcaster", and one of the monsters  is equipped with "Megamorph", after the switch, you change the ATK of  the monster that is equipped with "Megamorph" using the effect of  "Megamorph". With "Shield & Sword", since these are both Normal  Spell Cards, you resolve them in the order of their activation, and  recalculate their ATKs in that order.

- If either of the  targeted monsters is affect by "Shrink" before "Amazoness Spellcaster"  resolves, the ATK values printed on the monsters will be switched, and  the effect of "Shrink" effectively disappears. If a monster that has its original ATK changed by "Amazoness Spellcaster" is affected by  "Shrink", its ATK will become half of the changed original ATK.

#### AMAZONESS SWORDS WOMAN

*(1) The opponent takes all Battle Damage to this card's controller that  he/she would have taken from a battle involving this card.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
- "Amazoness Swordswoman" only applies her effect to Battle Damage to her  controller, so if attacked by a stronger monster, the "Amazoness  Swordswoman" herself is still destroyed as normal.

- Damage inflicted to the opponent when "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is  activated is Battle Damage, so the opponent cannot use "Barrel Behind  the Door".
- When "Dark Ruler Ha Des" attacks "Amazoness Swordswoman", the effect of "Amazoness Swordswoman" is still resolved.
- When a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Amazoness  Swordswoman", the "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is applied and the  opponent (who used "Diffusion Wave-Motion") takes the damage dealt to  Life Points. Likewise, the controller of "Spear Dragon" takes damages  when "Spear Dragon" battles "Amazoness Swordswoman" (or the controller  of a monster equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush", or who used  "Meteorain").
- When the controller of "Amazoness Swordswoman"  uses "Kuriboh", the controller takes zero Battle Damage so no damage is  dealt to the opponent.

- When "Susa Soldier" battles  "Amazoness Swordswoman", the controller of "Susa Soldier" takes full  damage; the damage is NOT halved.

#### AMAZONESS TIGER

*(1) You can only have 1 "Amazoness Tiger" on your side of the field. (2)  Increase the ATK of this card by 400 points for each monster on your  side of the field that includes "Amazoness" in its name, or is named  "Amazon Archer".

- The (1) Unclassified Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field (like a Continuous Effect).
  - If you have an "Amazoness Tiger" face-up, you can Set another "Amazoness  Tiger" face-down. If the face-down "Amazoness Tiger" is flipped face-up  by an attack, the flipped "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed after damage  calculation. If the face-down "Amazoness Tiger" is flipped with "Swords  of Revealing Light", etc., the flipped "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed  but the original "Amazoness Tiger" is not.
  - If both players  control a face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you use "Snatch Steal" on your  opponent's "Amazoness Tiger", then that "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed  after coming to your side of the field.
  - If both players have a  face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you give your opponent your "Amazoness  Tiger" with "Creature Swap", then your "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed.
  - If both players give their "Amazoness Tigers" to each other with "Creature Swap", neither is destroyed.

*Activate only when a face-up "Venom" monster you control is declared as an  attack target. Negate the attack and end the Battle Phase. Then place 1  Venom Counter on the monster that attacked.*

- This card’s  effect to “…end the Battle Phase.” causes play to enter the End Step of  the Battle Phase. The Venom Counter is placed on the monster that  attacked, then any other effects that happen “at the end of the Battle  Phase” are resolved.

- If you activate "Ambush Fangs",  and the attacking monster's attack is negated by a card chained to  "Ambush Fangs ("Negate Attack", etc.), you cannot place a Venom Counter  on the monster that attacked.

#### AMPHIBIOUS BUGROTH MK-3

*(1) While "Umi" is face-up on the field, this card can attack your opponent's Life Points directly.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - When "Umi" is on the field, and "Amphibious Bugroth MK-3" declares a direct  attack, and "Umi" is destroyed during the Battle Step, "Amphibious  Bugroth MK-3" can no longer attack directly, so a replay occurs.

#### AMPLIFIER

*Equip only to "Jinzo". While this card is equipped, the equipped monster's  effect does not negate the effects of its controller's Trap Cards. When  this card is removed from the field, destroy the equipped monster. This  card's activation and effect cannot be negated.*

- Note that "Amplifier"'s activation and effect cannot be negated. This is written on the card.

- It is the controller of "Jinzo" equipped with "Amplifier", not the controller of "Amplifier", that can activate Trap Cards.

- If the controller of  "Jinzo" with "Amplifier" has activated the effects of "Regulation of  Tribe", "Spatial Collapse", "Robbin' Goblin", "Robbin' Zombie", "Curse  of Darkness", etc., their effects are not negated, but if the opponent  activates them, they ARE negated.
- If your "Amplifier" is  switched from your "Jinzo" to your opponent's "Jinzo" with "Tailor of  the Fickle", then your Jinzo is not destroyed.

- You  cannot activate a card that would cause an infinite loop because its  effect cannot resolve completely. Example #1: You activate "Snatch  Steal" targeting your opponent's "Jinzo". You then equip "Jinzo" with  "Amplifier". You cannot activate "Imperial Order" because it cannot  resolve completely (it would negate "Snatch Steal", returning "Jinzo" to your opponent, which would negate "Imperial Order" so "Snatch Steal"  would re-activate). If you activate "Imperial Order" by mistake in such a situation, flip it face-down again. Example #2: you control "Jinzo"  equipped with "Amplifier" and "Skill Drain". Your opponent cannot  activate "Royal Decree".

#### AMULET OF AMBITION

- If "Imperial Order" & "Necrovalley" are both active, and "An Owl of  Luck" is flipped, you add the card to your hand because "Necrovalley" is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.
- If  "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained to the effect to destroy  "Necrovalley", so that "Necrovalley" is not on the field when this  effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.

- You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.

#### AN UNFORTUNATE REPORT

*Your opponent conducts their next Battle Phase twice.*

- If you activate “An Unfortunate Report” during your turn and your opponent decides not to enter the Battle Phase of their following turn, they  will conduct two Battle Phases the next time that they decide to conduct their Battle Phase, in a later turn.

  - This card can be targeted by “Mystical Space Typhoon,” etc., but this card will not be destroyed.

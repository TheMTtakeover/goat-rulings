## Card Rulings

#### 3-HUMP LACOODA

*(1) If there are 3 face-up "3-Hump Lacooda" cards on your side of the field, Tribute 2 of them to draw 3 cards.*

- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
- You don't have to activate "3-Hump Lacooda"'s effect just because you have 3 copies in play.
- You can choose which of the "3-Hump Lacoodas"' effects you are activating;  it can be one of the ones you are Tributing or the one that is remaining on the field.
- Tributing 2 "3-Hump Lacoodas" is a cost.
- If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" or "Book of Moon" to the  activation of "3-Hump Lacooda"'s effect, the effect is not negated.
- If you Summon your third "3-Hump Lacooda", you can activate its effect before your opponent activates "Torrential Tribute".


#### 7

*When there are 3 face-up "7" cards on your side of the field, draw 3 cards  from your Deck. Then destroy all "7" cards. When this card is sent  directly from the field to your Graveyard, increase your Life Points by  700 points.*

- If you have 3 "7"'s and destroy them all, you get 2100 Life Points.
- If your opponent also has "7"'s, they are also destroyed.
- If you have 3 "7"'s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain "Imperial Order" to negate the effect.
- Each effect of "7" that gives you 700 Life Points goes on a chain, so if  multiple "7"'s are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the chain.
- If other cards are also sent to the  Graveyard at the same time, like "Sangan" or "Black Pendant", the card  controlled by the turn player is Step 1.
- If your 3rd "7" is  activated, but destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon" in a chain, you  can't activate its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its  Graveyard effect.


#### 8-CLAWS SCORPION

*(1) Once per turn, you can flip this card into face-down Defense Position.  (2) When this card attacks an opponent's face-down Defense Position  monster, this card's ATK becomes 2400 during damage calculation only.*

- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - If you use this effect, then Flip Summon this card: you cannot used this effect again that turn [[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-flip-flop-fundamentals)].
- The (2) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect is applied if the condition is correct on activation ("8-Claws  Scorpion" declared an attack against a face-down Defense Position  monster.) The target monster does not have to be in face-down Defense  Position when the effect of "8-Claws Scorpion" is resolved. So if "Final Attack Orders" is active, or "Ceasefire" flips the monster face-up,  "8-Claws Scorpion" still gets its 2400 ATK.
  - The ATK of "8-Claws  Scorpion" becomes 2400 during damage calculation. You cannot chain "Rush Recklessly" or "Blast with Chain" to this effect. If these cards were  activated before damage calculation, then the ATK of "8-Claws Scorpion"  becomes 2400 during damage calculation so those cards have no effect on  its ATK.
  - Even if "8-Claws Scorpion" is equipped with an Equip  Spell Card, its ATK is 2400 when it attacks a face-down Defense Position monster.


#### A CAT OF ILL OMEN

*FLIP: Select 1 Trap Card from your Deck and place it on top of your Deck. If  "Necrovalley" is on the field, you can add the selected Trap Card to  your hand instead.*

- Show the card to your opponent.
- If "Imperial Order" & "Necrovalley" are both active, and "A Cat of Ill Omen" is flipped, you add the card to your hand because "Necrovalley"  is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.
- If  "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained to the effect to destroy  "Necrovalley", so that "Necrovalley" is not on the field when this  effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.
- You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.


#### 'A' CELL BREEDING DEVICE

*(1) During each of your Standby Phases, put 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - You can select a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards  as the monster to put an A-Counter on, but the counter will not be  placed.


#### 'A' CELL INCUBATOR

*(1) Each time an A-Counter(s) is removed from play by a card effect, place 1 A-Counter on this card. (2) When this card is destroyed, distribute the A-Counters on this card among face-up monsters.*

- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
  - This effect does not use the Chain.
  - If an A-Counter is removed to pay a cost, an A-Counter is placed upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
  - If an A-Counter on this card is removed by an effect, place an A-Counter upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
  - The effect of “’A’ Cell Incubator” is not applied when A-Counters are  removed because the card with the A-Counters was removed from the field  or flipped face-down, because these A-Counters are not removed by an  effect.
- The (2) mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
  - You may place A-Counters on face-up monsters on either field.


#### 'A' CELL SCATTER BURST

*Select 1 face-up "Alien" monster you control. Destroy it and distribute new  A-Counters equal to its Level among your opponent's face-up monsters.*

- This effect targets 1 face-up “Alien” monster you control.
- You choose which monsters to put the A-Counters on when this effect resolves.
- You can distribute the A-Counters however you wish among your opponent’s face-up monsters.
- You must place exactly as many A-Counters as the Level of the monster targeted by this effect.
- You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls no face-up monsters.


#### A DEAL WITH DARK RULER

*You can only activate this card during a turn in which a Level 8 or higher  monster on your side of the field was sent to the Graveyard. Special  Summon 1 "Berserk Dragon" from your hand or Deck.*

- The "Level" in "A Deal with Dark Ruler" is the original Level printed on the Monster Card.
- If your opponent's Level 8 or higher monster than you control is sent to  the Graveyard, you can activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler".
- You cannot activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler" during the Damage Step.
- You can only Special Summon 1 monster with "A Deal with Dark Ruler", but  you can activate 2 copies of "A Deal with Dark Ruler" to Special Summon 1 "Berserk Dragon" for each, even if only 1 Level 8 or higher monster was sent to the Graveyard.
- You can activate "A Deal with Dark  Ruler" if your Level 8 or higher monster that is an Equip Spell Card is  sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard (such as "Koitsu" or  "Dark Necrofear" destroyed by "Heavy Storm").


#### A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX

*Discard 1 card. Select 1 card from your Graveyard and return it to the top of your Deck.*

- Discarding 1 card is a cost. Your opponent can chain "D.D. Crow".
- This is an effect that targets.
- You can target a Fusion / Synchro Monster in the Graveyard, but it is returned to the Extra Deck.
- You can target the card you discarded for the cost of "A Feather of the  Phoenix" to be the card returned to the top of your Deck. If you  discarded "Night Assailant" or "Makyura the Destructor", then their  effects will activate.


#### A FEINT PLAN

*A player cannot attack face-down monsters during this turn.*

- If "A Feint Plan" is activated and you control only face-down monsters,  your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack  your Life Points directly either.

- If you activate "A  Feint Plan" after your opponent declares an attack against one of your  face-down monsters, that attack resolves as normal, but they cannot  attack other face-down monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is  because "A Feint Plan" prevents declaring an attack against a face-down  monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time "A Feint  Plan" resolves during the Battle Step.)


#### A HERO EMERGES

*You can only activate this card when your opponent declares an attack. Your opponent selects 1 random card from your hand. If it is a Monster Card, Special Summon it on your side of the field. If not, send it to the  Graveyard.*

- You can Special Summon a high-level monster, like "Dark Magician", with "A Hero Emerges". But if your opponent selects a  Special Summon-only monster like "Dark Necrofear", or a Spirit Monster,  it is sent to the Graveyard.

- When "Guardian Elma" is  selected for "A Hero Emerges", and you have "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field, you can Special Summon her, but if you don't  have it, then she is sent to the Graveyard.

- You can activate "A Hero Emerges" even if you have only 1 card in your hand.


#### A LEGENDARY OCEAN

*(C) This card's name is treated as "Umi". (1) Reduce the Level of all WATER monsters in both players' hands and on the field by 1. (2) All WATER monsters gain 200 ATK and DEF.*

- The (C) Condition cannot be negated, it applies in the Deck:
  - You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between "A Legendary Ocean" and  "Umi", because this card’s name is treated as "Umi". So you cannot have 3 copies of "Umi" and 3 copies of "A Legendary Ocean" in your Deck.
  - The name of "A Legendary Ocean" is treated as "Umi" always and for all  purposes. If "Imperial Order" is active, the card name is still treated  as "Umi". If the opponent activates "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell" targeting "Umi", you cannot activate "Umi" or "A Legendary Ocean" for  the rest of the Duel.
  - When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may activate "Tornado Wall".
- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER  Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4  monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show  your opponent.
  - When the effect of "Cyber Jar" is activated and  "A Legendary Ocean" is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5  WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of "Cyber Jar". This is because  the effect of "A Legendary Ocean" does not include Monster Cards in the  Deck.
  - If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Gravity Bind" are active, you  may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If "A Legendary Ocean" is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay  occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.
  - If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Infinite Dismissal" are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be  destroyed during the End Phase.
- The (2) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, "The Legendary Fisherman" on the field  is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus  or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your  hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.
  - "A Legendary Ocean" does not have the effect of "Umi" that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.


#### A MAN WITH WDJAT

*(1) When you Normal Summon this card, and during each of your Standby  Phases, select 1 Set card on your opponent's side of the field. Pick it  up and look at it, then return it to its original position.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
- If you Set "A Man with Wdjat", its effect is not activated.

- Any effects of the card you look at are not activated when you look at them with "A Man with Wdjat" (such as a Flip Effect, or if it is a Trap  Card, etc.).

#### A RIVAL APPEARS!

*Select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Special Summon 1 monster from your hand that has the same Level as the selected monster.*

- For the effect of “A Rival Appears!”, refer to the levels of the monster on the field and the monster in the hand at the time “A Rival Appears!”  resolves (for purposes of “Cost Down”, “Level Conversion Lab”, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain destroying “Demotion”, etc.)

- If the opponent’s monster is face-down or not on the field when “A Rival Appears!” resolves, then its effect disappears.

- If you do not have a monster of the same level as the target, you cannot activate “A Rival Appears!”

#### A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON

*Return 1 face-up Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster you control to the owner's hand and destroy all Spell and Trap Cards.*

- "A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon" targets 1 Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster.

- If you target a Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type Fusion / Synchro Monster, it is returned to the Extra Deck.

- If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field / has its Monster  Type changed, "A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon's" effect disappears.

#### ABARE USHIONI

*(1) Once per turn, you can toss a coin and call it. If you call it right,  inflict 1000 damage to your opponent. If you call it wrong, you take  1000 damage.*

- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
- If you call the coin toss wrong for “Abare Ushioni” you can still prevent the damage with “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, etc.

- You cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the effect of “Abare Ushioni”  because you don’t know yet if you will take damage or not from the  effect.

#### ABSOLUTE END

*Activate only during your opponent's turn. This turn, the attacks from your opponent's monsters become direct attacks.*

- When "Absolute End" is activated during an attack, that attack becomes a direct attack.

- If "Taunt" and "Absolute End" are both active, the attack becomes a direct attack to your Life Points. This is because the attack target is the  monster selected by "Taunt", but then "Absolute End" turns it into a  direct attack.

#### ABSORBING KID FROM THE SKY

*(1) When this card destroys a monster and sends it to the Graveyard as a  result of battle, increase your Life Points by the Level of the  destroyed monster x 300 points.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - This card must be face-up on the field to activate this effect [[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-will-it-trigger)].
  - The Level is the original Level printed on the card.

#### ABYSSAL DESIGNATOR

*Pay 1000 Life Points. Declare a Type and an Attribute. Your opponent must  send 1 monster with both the declared Type and Attribute from their hand or Deck to the Graveyard.*

- If your opponent sends a monster  to the Graveyard with the declared Type and Attribute, you cannot see  their hand and Deck. But if they claim to have no such card, you can  check their hand and Deck to confirm.

#### ACID TRAP HOLE

*Select 1 face-down Defense Position monster. Flip it face-up, and if the DEF  of the monster is 2000 points or less, destroy the monster. If the DEF  is more than 2000 points, return the monster to face-down Defense  Position.*

- A face-down "Jinzo" will be destroyed by this card.

- If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as "Enraged Muka Muka", calculate the current DEF, then determine if it  will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in  your hand, "Enraged Muka Muka" would not be destroyed.

- If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated  whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected  monster is 2000 or less, such as a "Hane-Hane", it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.

#### ADHESION TRAP HOLE

*Activate only when your opponent Summons a monster(s). While that monster(s) is  face-up on the field, its original ATK is halved.*

- "Adhesion Trap Hole" works against "a monster or monsters", so "Adhesion Trap Hole" does NOT target.

- When "Cyber Jar" is activated, you may use "Adhesion Trap Hole" against all  monsters your opponent Special Summons in face-up Attack Position, but  "Adhesion Trap Hole" has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons face-down.
- "Adhesion Trap Hole" cannot affect monsters Special Summoned face-down with "The Shallow Grave", "Morphing Jar #2", etc.
- If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is flipped face-down (with  "Book of Moon", etc.), "Adhesion Trap Hole"'s effect disappears and the  monster's ATK is back to normal.
- "Adhesion Trap Hole" halves the original ATK, so if you activate another effect that alters ATK, halve  the original ATK first and then resolve the other ATK-modifying effect.

- If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is then equipped with "Megamorph", only "Megamorph"'s effect applies.

#### ADHESIVE EXPLOSIVE

*(1) If an opponent's monster attacks this face-down Defense Position card,  this card becomes an Equip Card equipped to the attacking monster,  without applying damage calculation. (2) Destroy the equipped monster  during the Standby Phase of your opponent's next turn.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 3 - Before Damage Calculation.
  - If “Mystic Swordsman LV2” attacks, its effect will not activate.
  - If “Drillroid” attacks it, its effect will activate.
  - If this face-down card is attacked by “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6”  or “Guardian Kay’est”, it will still be equipped to the attacker, but it will not destroy the equipped monster during the Standby Phase.
- The (2) Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
  - This effect is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card.

#### ADVANCE DRAW

*Tribute 1 face-up Level 8 or higher monster you control. Draw 2 cards.*

- Tributing 1 face-up Level 8 or higher monster is a cost.

#### ADVANCE FORCE

*(1) You can Tribute 1 Level 5 or higher monster to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher monster.*

- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
  - You can still Tribute 2 monsters to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher monster if you want to.
  - Only the controller of “Advance Force” gets the effect.

#### ADVANCED RITUAL ART

*Select 1 Ritual Monster in your hand. Send Normal Monsters from your Deck to  the Graveyard whose total Levels are equal to that Ritual Monster's.  Ritual Summon a card with the name of the selected Ritual Monster from  your hand.*

- This effect does not target anything.

- You choose the Ritual Monster you want to Ritual Summon when the effect resolves.
- You send the Normal Monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard when the effect resolves.

#### AEGIS OF THE OCEAN DRAGON LORD

*Until the End Phase of this turn, face-up Level 3 or lower WATER monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle or by card effects.*

- You can still activate this card even if you control no face-up Level 3 or lower WATER monsters at the time.
- This effect is applied until you choose to end it during the End Phase.
- This effect applies to all Level 3 or lower WATER monsters you control, even ones that you Summon after this card’s resolution.

#### AFTER GENOCIDE

*This card can only be activated during Main Phase 1. All monsters on both  sides of the field that have been involved in damage calculation are  destroyed during the End Step of the turn.*

- This card's title has been changed to "After the Struggle". If you have a card titled  "After Genocide" its name is treated as "After the Struggle".

- Even if the Battle Damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku",  "Kuriboh", "Sanga of the Thunder", etc., both the attacking and  defending monster are still destroyed during the End Step by this card’s effect.
- If you activate "After the Struggle", even a monster  that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect  during the End Step.

- Note that "After the Struggle" will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.

#### AFTER THE STRUGGLE

*This card can only be activated during Main Phase 1. All monsters on both  sides of the field that have been involved in damage calculation are  destroyed during the End Step of the turn.*

- This card's title has been changed to "After the Struggle". If you have a card titled  "After Genocide" its name is treated as "After the Struggle".

- If you activate "After the Struggle", even a monster  that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect  during the End Step.

- Note that "After the Struggle" will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.

#### AGAINST THE WIND

*Select 1 "Blackwing" monster in your Graveyard. Take damage equal to the ATK of the selected monster, and add it to your hand.*

- “Against the Wind” targets 1 “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard.
- If you control “Des Wombat,” you can activate “Against the Wind,” but  since the damage you take becomes 0, you cannot add a card to your hand.
- If an effect is chained that removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard, you take no damage and do not add it to your hand.
- The effects of “Against the Wind” to inflict damage and add a card to your  hand are considered to be simultaneous, although as a practical matter  you take the damage first.
  - This means that you can activate effects like “Numinous Healer” without missing the timing.

#### AGIDO

*(1) When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of  battle, roll a six-sided die. You can Special Summon 1 Fairy-Type  monster from your Graveyard whose Level is equal to the number rolled.  (If the result is 6, you can Special Summon a Level 6 or higher  monster.)*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - "Agido" can Special Summon itself.
  - This effect does not target.

#### AIRKNIGHT PARSHATH

*(1) During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position  monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the  difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. (2) When this card  inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, draw 1 card.*

  - This effect will not apply if "Total Defense Shogun" attacks this card from Defense Position.
- The (2) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
  - Drawing a card is not optional. You must draw 1 card any time "Airknight  Parshath" inflicts Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points. This  includes direct attacks, and when it battles with a monster with a lower ATK or DEF.
  - If the opponent activates "Waboku" or "Kuriboh" to reduce the Battle Damage to 0, you do not draw.
  - When "Airknight Parshath" attacks a face-down monster with a Flip Effect and inflicts Battle Damage, you draw 1 card before the Flip Effect is  activated (in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects).

#### ALCHEMY CYCLE

*The original ATK of all face-up monsters you control becomes 0, until the  End Phase. Each time a monster that had its original ATK reduced to 0 by this effect is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1  card.*

- Monsters with an original ATK that is already 0 are  not affected by "Alchemy Cycle". You will not draw a card when they are  destroyed by battle.

- The effect to draw 1 card starts a Chain.

- Monsters Summoned or flipped face-up after "Alchemy Cycle" resolves will not have their original ATK become 0.

#### ALIEN AMMONITE

*(1) When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or  lower "Alien" monster from your Graveyard. Destroy it during the End  Phase.*

- The (1) optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing.

- You can take control of Reptile-Type monsters with this card.
  - If you control your opponent’s Reptile-Type monster and it is destroyed  and sent to their Graveyard you can activate “Alien Brain.”

#### ALIEN GREY

*FLIP: Place 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the  field. ((1) If a monster with an A-Counter battles an "Alien" monster,  it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation  only.) (2) After this card has been flipped face-up, when it is  destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1 card.*

- The Flip Effect is mandatory.
- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - If this card is not on the field, a monster with an A-Counter won't lose ATK when battling an "Alien".
  - If 2 "Alien Grey" (or other monsters with the A-Counter text) are on the  field, then a monster with 1 A-Counter will lose 600 ATK while battling  an "Alien".
- The (2) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
  - The effect to draw a card when "Alien Grey" has been flipped face-up is  activated even if it had been flipped face-up earlier in the Duel  (including Flip Summoned or being changed face-up by a card effect). It  does not have to be flipped face-up as a result of the battle that  destroyed it.

#### ALIEN HUNTER

*(1) If this card destroys a monster with an A-Counter by battle, it can attack once again in a row.*

- The (1) optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - You can also end the Battle Phase without attacking again by this effect.
- "Alien Hunter" does not have the A-Counter ATK reduction effect. So if it is  the only "Alien" you control, and it battles a monster with an  A-Counter, that opposing monster will NOT lose 300 ATK.

#### ALIEN HYPNO

*(U) This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or  in the Graveyard. (C) While this card is face-up on the field, you can  Normal Summon it to have it be treated as an Effect Monster with this  effect:*
*● (1) During your Main Phase, you can select 1  monster your opponent controls with an A-Counter(s), and take control of it while this card is on the field.

- The (1) Ignition Effect can be activated multiple times during the same turn.
  - This effect targets the selected monster, both when the monster is selected  and as long as the selected monster remains on the field.
  - If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and “Skill  Drain” is activated, control of the selected monster is returned to the  opponent. If “Skill Drain” is later negated or removed from the field,  the selected monster is returned to your control.
  - If you take  control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and afterwards  “Alien Hypno” is flipped face-down, every monster that you are  controlling with “Alien Hypno’s” effect is returned to your opponent.
  - If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and  afterwards the selected monster is flipped face-down, the selected  monster is returned to your opponent.
- The (2) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up AND treated as an Effect Monster.

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - This effect does not retroactively place A-Counters on Special Summoned monsters.

  - If "Alien  Kid" is face-up on the field when multiple monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously, then each Special Summoned monster gains one A-Counter.

*You can activate this card when your opponent declares an attack and if  there is a monster(s) on your side of the field that includes  "Amazoness" in its card name, or is named "Amazon Archer". All monsters  on your opponent's side of the field are changed to face-up Attack  Position (Flip Effects are not activated), and as long as they remain  face-up on the field, their ATK(s) are decreased by 500 points. Your  opponent must attack with all of his/her monsters.*

- "These  monsters" means all of your opponent's face-up monsters on the field at  the time "Amazoness Archers" resolves, not just the monsters that were  flipped by "Amazoness Archers"' effect.

- If you activate "Amazoness Archers" during the Battle Phase and your opponent Special  Summons another monster afterwards (such as with "Call of the Haunted",  or if "Cyber Jar" is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not  affected by "Amazoness Archers" and does not suffer the -500 ATK  reduction nor does it have to attack.
- The -500 ATK applies to  each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You  can activate multiple "Amazoness Archers" and the ATK reductions are  cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies).
- "Amazoness Archers" vs. "Cat's Ear Tribe": the ATK is 200.
- If "Fushioh Richie" or "Otohime" are flipped face-up by "Amazoness  Archers' effect, their effects are activated because their effects are  not Flip Effects; their effects begin a new chain that resolves after  the current chain.
- If a face-down "Jinzo" is flipped by "Amazoness Archers", "Amazoness Archers"' effect is not negated.
- The effect of "Amazoness Archers" will make your opponent have to attack  with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the  field. If "Amazoness Archers" is in effect, and later a replay occurs,  your opponent cannot choose not to attack.
- Monsters that have  already attacked cannot attack again. If "The Dark Door" is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot  attack still cannot attack (Toon Monsters the turn they are Summoned,  "Ultimate Obedient Fiend" under the wrong conditions, etc.) If  "Diffusion Wave-Motion" is in effect, only the monster affected by  "Diffusion Wave-Motion" can attack. The ATK reduction of "Amazoness  Archers" is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack.
- If you activate "Amazoness Archers" and chain "Magic Cylinder", "Magic  Cylinder" does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your  opponent's other monsters must attack normally. If you chain "Amazoness  Archers" to "Magic Cylinder", the ATK is reduced first and then "Magic  Cylinder" does damage.

- If either player chains "Negate Attack" to "Amazoness Archers", the Battle Phase ends because of "Negate Attack"'s effect.

  - This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
  - When a monster selected for "Amazoness Blowpiper"'s effect is flipped face-down, the effect is reset.

  - This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - If you get your opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master” and it’s  placed on the field, and later returned to the hand with “Penguin  Soldier”, it returns to the original owner’s hand.
  - You cannot activate the effect of “Amazoness Chain Master” if your opponent has no hand.
  - If you have your opponent’s monster that you acquired with “Amazoness  Chain Master”, and your opponent activates “Disturbance Strategy”, the  monster returns to the owner’s Deck. However, you draw the same number  of cards that you had in your hand, including 1 card for the monster you acquired with “Amazoness Chain Master”.
  - If you acquired your  opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master”, and “Remove  Brainwashing” is activated, the monster returns to the original owner if it is on the field. However, if it’s still in your hand then it is not  returned.
  - If you acquire your opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master” and your opponent uses “Lightforce Sword” on it, it  returns to your hand (not the owner’s hand) after the effect of  “Lightforce Sword” expires.

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
- "Amazoness Paladin" counts herself in her effect, so even by herself she gains +100 ATK.

#### AMAZONESS SPELLCASTER

*Until the end of this turn, switch the original ATK of 1 face-up monster on  your side of field that includes "Amazoness" in its card name or is  named "Amazon Archer", with the original ATK of 1 face-up monster on  your opponent's side of the field.*

- "Amazoness Spellcaster"  targets (it targets 2 monsters), so when you activate "Amazoness  Spellcaster" you select 1 face-up Amazoness on your side of the field  and 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field.

- You can select "Gradius' Option" as the other monster, and the original ATK of the Amazoness will now be the ATK of "Gradius' Option" at the time  "Amazoness Spellcaster" resolves. The ATK of "Gradius' Option" remains  as the ATK of "Gradius" and does not become the ATK of the Amazoness.
- If you activate "Amazoness Spellcaster", and chain "Dramatic Rescue", "Amazoness Spellcaster"'s effect disappears.
- If you switch ATKs with "Amazoness Spellcaster", and one of the monsters  is equipped with "Megamorph", after the switch, you change the ATK of  the monster that is equipped with "Megamorph" using the effect of  "Megamorph". With "Shield & Sword", since these are both Normal  Spell Cards, you resolve them in the order of their activation, and  recalculate their ATKs in that order.

- If either of the  targeted monsters is affect by "Shrink" before "Amazoness Spellcaster"  resolves, the ATK values printed on the monsters will be switched, and  the effect of "Shrink" effectively disappears. If a monster that has its original ATK changed by "Amazoness Spellcaster" is affected by  "Shrink", its ATK will become half of the changed original ATK.

#### AMAZONESS SWORDS WOMAN

*(1) The opponent takes all Battle Damage to this card's controller that  he/she would have taken from a battle involving this card.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
- "Amazoness Swordswoman" only applies her effect to Battle Damage to her  controller, so if attacked by a stronger monster, the "Amazoness  Swordswoman" herself is still destroyed as normal.

- Damage inflicted to the opponent when "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is  activated is Battle Damage, so the opponent cannot use "Barrel Behind  the Door".
- When "Dark Ruler Ha Des" attacks "Amazoness Swordswoman", the effect of "Amazoness Swordswoman" is still resolved.
- When a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Amazoness  Swordswoman", the "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is applied and the  opponent (who used "Diffusion Wave-Motion") takes the damage dealt to  Life Points. Likewise, the controller of "Spear Dragon" takes damages  when "Spear Dragon" battles "Amazoness Swordswoman" (or the controller  of a monster equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush", or who used  "Meteorain").
- When the controller of "Amazoness Swordswoman"  uses "Kuriboh", the controller takes zero Battle Damage so no damage is  dealt to the opponent.

- When "Susa Soldier" battles  "Amazoness Swordswoman", the controller of "Susa Soldier" takes full  damage; the damage is NOT halved.

#### AMAZONESS TIGER

*(1) You can only have 1 "Amazoness Tiger" on your side of the field. (2)  Increase the ATK of this card by 400 points for each monster on your  side of the field that includes "Amazoness" in its name, or is named  "Amazon Archer".

- The (1) Unclassified Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field (like a Continuous Effect).
  - If you have an "Amazoness Tiger" face-up, you can Set another "Amazoness  Tiger" face-down. If the face-down "Amazoness Tiger" is flipped face-up  by an attack, the flipped "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed after damage  calculation. If the face-down "Amazoness Tiger" is flipped with "Swords  of Revealing Light", etc., the flipped "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed  but the original "Amazoness Tiger" is not.
  - If both players  control a face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you use "Snatch Steal" on your  opponent's "Amazoness Tiger", then that "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed  after coming to your side of the field.
  - If both players have a  face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you give your opponent your "Amazoness  Tiger" with "Creature Swap", then your "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed.
  - If both players give their "Amazoness Tigers" to each other with "Creature Swap", neither is destroyed.

*Activate only when a face-up "Venom" monster you control is declared as an  attack target. Negate the attack and end the Battle Phase. Then place 1  Venom Counter on the monster that attacked.*

- This card’s  effect to “…end the Battle Phase.” causes play to enter the End Step of  the Battle Phase. The Venom Counter is placed on the monster that  attacked, then any other effects that happen “at the end of the Battle  Phase” are resolved.

- If you activate "Ambush Fangs",  and the attacking monster's attack is negated by a card chained to  "Ambush Fangs ("Negate Attack", etc.), you cannot place a Venom Counter  on the monster that attacked.

#### AMPHIBIOUS BUGROTH MK-3

*(1) While "Umi" is face-up on the field, this card can attack your opponent's Life Points directly.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - When "Umi" is on the field, and "Amphibious Bugroth MK-3" declares a direct  attack, and "Umi" is destroyed during the Battle Step, "Amphibious  Bugroth MK-3" can no longer attack directly, so a replay occurs.

#### AMPLIFIER

*Equip only to "Jinzo". While this card is equipped, the equipped monster's  effect does not negate the effects of its controller's Trap Cards. When  this card is removed from the field, destroy the equipped monster. This  card's activation and effect cannot be negated.*

- Note that "Amplifier"'s activation and effect cannot be negated. This is written on the card.

- It is the controller of "Jinzo" equipped with "Amplifier", not the controller of "Amplifier", that can activate Trap Cards.

- If the controller of  "Jinzo" with "Amplifier" has activated the effects of "Regulation of  Tribe", "Spatial Collapse", "Robbin' Goblin", "Robbin' Zombie", "Curse  of Darkness", etc., their effects are not negated, but if the opponent  activates them, they ARE negated.
- If your "Amplifier" is  switched from your "Jinzo" to your opponent's "Jinzo" with "Tailor of  the Fickle", then your Jinzo is not destroyed.

- You  cannot activate a card that would cause an infinite loop because its  effect cannot resolve completely. Example #1: You activate "Snatch  Steal" targeting your opponent's "Jinzo". You then equip "Jinzo" with  "Amplifier". You cannot activate "Imperial Order" because it cannot  resolve completely (it would negate "Snatch Steal", returning "Jinzo" to your opponent, which would negate "Imperial Order" so "Snatch Steal"  would re-activate). If you activate "Imperial Order" by mistake in such a situation, flip it face-down again. Example #2: you control "Jinzo"  equipped with "Amplifier" and "Skill Drain". Your opponent cannot  activate "Royal Decree".

#### AMULET OF AMBITION

- If "Imperial Order" & "Necrovalley" are both active, and "An Owl of  Luck" is flipped, you add the card to your hand because "Necrovalley" is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.
- If  "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained to the effect to destroy  "Necrovalley", so that "Necrovalley" is not on the field when this  effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.

- You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.

#### AN UNFORTUNATE REPORT

*Your opponent conducts their next Battle Phase twice.*

- If you activate “An Unfortunate Report” during your turn and your opponent decides not to enter the Battle Phase of their following turn, they  will conduct two Battle Phases the next time that they decide to conduct their Battle Phase, in a later turn.

  - This card can be targeted by “Mystical Space Typhoon,” etc., but this card will not be destroyed.

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies the turn this card is Summoned.
  - If you Summon "Armor Exe", flip it face-down with "Book of Moon", and flip it face-up with "Book of Taiyou", it CAN attack because its non-attack  effect was reset AND because flipping it face-up with "Book of Taiyou"  was NOT a Flip Summon.

(2) Once per turn,  while equipped to a monster by this effect, you can decrease the  equipped monster's ATK by 1000 and destroy 1 face-up monster. (C) (A  monster can only by equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the  equipped monster would be destroyed, destroy this card instead.)*

- "Armored Cybern's" effect to destroy 1 monster targets. The ATK of the equipped monster is decreased when this effect resolves.
- If "Reverse Trap" is activated, the equipped monster will gain 1000 ATK  instead of losing 1000 ATK. When the turn ends, the ATK gain will become an ATK loss.
- When "Armored Cybern" is unequipped or removed from the field, the ATK lost with its effect is no longer applied.
- When "Armored Cybern" is equipped to a monster that is unaffected by the  effects of Spell Cards, you can activate its effect but the effect  disappears because the equipped monster's ATK cannot be reduced with  "Armored Cybern's" effect.

    - This ruling changed in January 2011, inflicing damage equal to the original ATK [REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=20342358&postcount=3)].
- VS. "Colossal Fighter": Player A equips "Armory Arm" to Player B's "Archfiend Soldier",  bringing its ATK to 2900. Player A's "Colossal Fighter" (ATK/2800)  attacks "Archfiend Soldier" (ATK/2900), and Player A takes 100 Points of damage in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. In Substep 7 - End of the  Damage Step, Player A activates the mandatory Trigger-like Effect of  "Armory Arm" (as Chain Link 1) and the optional Trigger Effect of  "Colossal Fighter" (as Chain Link 2, targeting itself). When the Chain  resolves, "Colossal Fighter" Special Summons itself, then "Armory Arm"  deals 2800 Points of Effect Damage to Player B.

#### ARRAY OF REVEALING LIGHT

*Declare 1 Type of monster. (1) Any monster of the declared Type cannot declare  an attack during the turn it is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned or  Special Summoned.*

- You declare the Type of monster when you  activate this card, not when it resolves. This means you pick the Type  before the opponent decides whether to chain or not.
- You cannot  change your mind about the Type after you activate this card. The  declared Type remains the same as long as this card is on the field.
- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - This effect does not target, so the effects of "Lord of D." or "Frontier  Wiseman" will not protect monsters from this card’s effect.
  - If  the Type of a monster is changed (by the effect of "DNA Surgery" for  example) during the turn which it was Summoned, it may attack that turn.
  - If a monster of the declared Type is Summoned, then flipped face-down (by  "Book of Moon") and face-up again (by "Book of Taiyou"), it CAN attack  because the non-attack effect was reset AND because flipping it face-up  with "Book of Taiyou" was NOT a Flip Summon.

#### ARSENAL BUG

*(1) If there are no face-up Insect-Type monsters (except this monster) on  your side of the field, both the ATK and DEF of this monster become 1000 points.*

  - If you have 2 "Arsenal Bugs" on your side of the field, each has ATK 2000.
  - If the only other Insect-Type monster you control is face-down, the ATK of "Arsenal Bug" is 1000.
  - If the ATK of "Arsenal Bug" is 1000, and it is equipped with an Equip  Spell Card or modified by a Field Spell Card, recalculate. So begin with the 1000 ATK, then increase or decrease from there according to other  card effects.
  - When "Arsenal Bug" is Summoned and there are no  other Insect-Type monsters on your side of the field, "Bottomless Trap  Hole" can't activate because its ATK is 1000 when Summoned.
  - If you equip "Megamorph" to "Arsenal Bug" then its ATK will be 4000 or 1000, depending on "Megamorph"’s effect.

#### ARSENAL SUMMONER

*FLIP: Add 1 card that includes "Guardian" in its card name from your Deck to  your hand. You cannot add "Celtic Guardian", "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1", "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #2",  "Guardian of of the Labyrinth", or "The Reliable Guardian".*

*Select 1 monster on your side of the field to activate this card. Destroy the  selected card and send 2 cards from the top of your opponent's Deck to  the Graveyard.*

- This effect targets 1 monster you control.
- This effect resolves sequentially: destroy the target, then mill 2 cards from your opponent's Deck.
  - If you destroy “Peten the Dark Clown”, you miss the timing on its  activation because it was not the last effect to resolve, so you cannot  Special Summon another “Peten the Dark Clown”.
- If the target can't be destroyed, you don't send cards from your opponent’s Deck to the Graveyard.

#### ASTRAL BARRIER

*(1) If your opponent's monster attacks a monster on your side of the field, you can make the attack a direct attack.*

- The effect of "Astral Barrier" does not target the attacking monster.
- If "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" is chained to "Astral Barrier",  "Astral Barrier" is applied. If "Astral Barrier" is chained to  "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation", "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" is  applied.

- The (1) Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
  - If the activation of this effect is negated (by "Light and Darkness  Dragon"), this effect will activate again until it resolves (even if it  resolves without effect due to "Skill Drain").
- The (2) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - "Asura Priest" may attack directly if it has not already attacked a monster this turn.
  - "Asura Priest" cannot attack a monster if it has already attacked directly this turn.
  - These attacks do not have to be all in a row. You can attack monsters with  "Asura Priest", then attack with another monster, and "Asura Priest" can still attack again as long as it attacks a monster it has not attacked  yet. If the opponent controls "Spirit Reaper" you cannot continually  attack it.
  - "Asura Priest" does not have to attack all your opponent’s monsters.
  - While "Gravekeeper’s Servant" / "Toll" is active, you pay each time "Asura Priest" attacks.
  - If “Asura Priest” attacks a monster and your opponent activates “Magic  Cylinder” to negate the attack, “Asura Priest” can attack that same  monster again.
  - Your opponent's "Patrician of Darkness" can re-direct all of your “Asura Priest” attacks to their “Spirit Reaper”.
  - When "Asura Priest" attacks your opponent’s only monster, if the monster is  removed from the field in the battle step, a replay occurs. Since Asura  Priest never battled with a monster it can attack directly.

*(C) Equip only to a Warrior-Type monster that is the only monster you  control. (1) It gains 300 ATK. (2) During your Main Phase, you can send  this equipped card to the Graveyard. If you do, the equipped monster can attack twice during the Battle Phase this turn.*

- The (C) Condition is not an effect, it can't be negated.
  - If “Assault Armor” is equipped to your monster, then after that you Summon another monster, “Assault Armor” remains on the field.
  - The  requirement that you control no other monsters only applies to equipping “Assault Armor”. If an effect is chained to “Assault Armor” that makes  the target no longer a Warrior, then “Assault Armor” cannot be equipped  to it, and is destroyed.
  - If the equipped monster’s type changes  after “Assault Armor” is already equipped to it, “Assault Armor” remains equipped to that monster.
- The (1) Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up and Equipped to a monster.
  - Equip Spell Cards continuously target the equipped monster.

Don't reveal the Deck if 3 copies of  that “/Assault Mode” monster are accounted for in your Graveyard / field / banished.

- “Assault Revival” can only Special Summon an “/Assault Mode” monster that was  properly Special Summoned in the first place, and was then sent to the  Graveyard. It cannot Special Summon an “/Assault Mode” monster that was  directly sent to the Graveyard from the hand or Deck.
- Only  effects on the field are negated by “Assault Revival”. If an “/Assault  Mode” monster is Special Summoned with “Assault Revival”, and is then  destroyed (and removed from play because of “Assault Revival”’s effect), its effect does activate and the appropriate Synchro Monster is Special Summoned.
- You must destroy at least 1 monster you control with  “Assault Revival” in order to Special Summon an “/Assault Mode” monster, as the effects are linked. You also must destroy all monsters you  control, so if 1 of your monsters was not destroyed, you cannot Summon  an “/Assault Mode” monster.
- A monster Special Summoned with  “Assault Revival” cannot activate its effects even if “Pole Position”  makes it unaffected by Spell Cards. If an “/Assault Mode” monster is  Special Summoned with “Assault Revival”, and is flipped face-down, the  restrictions from “Assault Revival” are wiped and you can Tribute it and (once it is face-up again) activate its effects.

#### AURKUS, LIGHTSWORN DRUID

*(1) "Lightsworn" monsters cannot be targeted by effects. (2) During each of your End Phases, send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies so long as this card is face-up on the field.
  - Card Effects can't target "Lightsworn" monsters on either field / Graveyard / banished.
  - "Lightsworn" monsters can't become equipped with Equip Spells. If they were already  Equipped before Aurkus' effect applied, those Equip Cards remain on the  field and are unaffected.
  - This does NOT negate effects; it only prevents "Lightsworn" monsters from being targeted.
    - Ex: If "Raigeki Break" targets a your "Lightsworn" monster and you chain  "Glorious Illusion" to Special Summon "Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid", your  "Lightsworn" monster is still destroyed.
  - VS. "Kycoo,  the Ghost Destroyer": If Kycoo destroys Aurkus by battle and inflicts  Battle Damage, Kycoo's Trigger Effect can activate in Substep 5 - After  Damage Calculation, but it can't target "Lightsworn" monsters. This is  because monsters with Continuous Effects that are destroyed by battle  only cease to apply those Continuous Effects in Substep 6 - Resolve  Effects..
  - If you Special Summon a "Lightsworn" monster with  "Glorious Illusion", and afterwards you Summon "Aurkus, Lightsworn  Druid", if your opponent later destroys "Glorious Illusion" your  "Lightsworn" monster is also destroyed because "Glorious Illusion" is  NOT targeting your "Lightsworn" monster.
- The (2) Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
  - If the activation of this effect is negated (by "Light and Darkness  Dragon"), this effect will activate again until it resolves (even if it  resolves without effect due to "Skill Drain") [[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)].
  - If you only have 1 card in your Deck when resolving this effect, it is sent to the Graveyard.
  - This card MUST be face-up on the field to activate AND resolve this effect.
  - If you resolve this effect and your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse",  after "Book of Eclipse" flips this affected monster face-up (and you  draw 1 card), this effect must activate again [[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)].
  - VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn"  monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A decides when to activate / resolve each effect:
    1. Player A can resolve "Brain  Control" first, returning the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That  "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, its  effect won't activate.
    2. Player A can activate the "Lightsworn's"  Trigger Effect to mill cards from their Deck. Then, Player A resolves  "Brain Control" and returns the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B [[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)].
  - VS. "Enemy Controller":
    - On Player A's turn, Player B takes control of Player A's "Lightsworn"  monster. During the End Phase, "Enemy Controller's" effect wears off and control of the "Lightsworn" monster returns to Player A, then that  Lightsworns's mandatory Trigger Effect activates [[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)].

  - If your opponent takes control of the target with “Mind Control”, control  still reverts to you after the effect of “Mind Control” expires (even  though it wasn’t your monster originally).
  - If your opponent  takes control of your monster with “Brain Control”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the  “Charmer” is face-up on the field.
  - If “Book of Moon” is chained  to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down,  the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.
  - If a “Charmer” is  removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.
  - If “DNA  Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a  “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s  Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the  controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.
  - If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its  effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled  monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still  destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.

#### AUTOMATIC LASER

- This effect targets 1 monster in your opponent Graveyard, it is negated by "Necrovalley".
- The (1) Continuous-like Effect does not start a Chain.
  - If this card returns to the hand (by "Giant Trunade"), destroy the equipped monster immediately.
  - If you use "Autonomous Action Unit" to Special Summon a monster from your  opponent's Graveyard and then activate "Dimensionhole", "Autonomous  Action Unit" is destroyed and when the monster returns to the field it  returns to the original owner's control.

You also cannot Tribute one of the  monsters Special Summoned by the effect of "Cyber Jar" since the timing  has passed.

#### B.E.S. COVERED CORE

*(1) When this card is Normal Summoned, put 2 counters on it. (2) This card  cannot be destroyed by battle. (3) If this card attacks or is attacked,  at the end of the Damage Step toss a coin and call it. If you call it  wrong, remove 1 counter.

- The (4) Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.

  - If “B.E.S. Covered Core” battles a monster, and afterwards you lose the  coin toss (for the (3) effect), so that “B.E.S. Covered Core” now has no counters, it is not destroyed. Because it still had a counter during  damage calculation.

#### B.E.S. CRYSTAL CORE

*(1) When this card is Normal Summoned, put 3 counters on it. (2) This card  cannot be destroyed by battle. (3) If this card attacks or is attacked,  remove 1 counter from this card at the end of the Damage Step. If you  cannot, destroy it.

- The (4) Ignition Effect targets, it activates & resolves on the field.
  - If you target the opponent’s monster with the effect of “B.E.S. Crystal  Core”, and an effect is chained that causes it to no longer be on your  opponent’s side of the field (such as “Remove Brainwashing” or “Enemy  Controller”), the effect of “B.E.S. Crystal Core” is not applied.

#### BACKFIRE

*When a FIRE monster(s) on your side of the field is destroyed and sent to  the Graveyard, inflict 500 points of damage to your opponent's Life  Points.*

- If a monster is FIRE because it is equipped with  "Scroll of Bewitchment", you cannot activate "Backfire"'s effect when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is no longer equipped when it  arrives in the Graveyard.
- When multiple FIRE monsters are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, the damage is only 500 points.
- If you control "Backfire" and your opponent's FIRE monster, you can  activate "Backfire"'s effect when your opponent's monster that you  control is destroyed.

#### BACKS TO THE WALL

*Pay Life Points so that you only have 100 left. Special Summon as many "Six Samurai" monsters from your Graveyard as possible. You cannot Special  Summon more than 1 monster with the same name, or a monster that has the same name as a monster on the field.*

- You cannot activate this card if your Life Points are exactly 100 or less than 100.
- You cannot activate this card if there are no “Six Samurai” monsters in your Graveyard.

#### BACKUP SOLDIER

*Activate only if there are 5 or more monsters in your Graveyard. Add up to 3  non-Effect Monsters with 1500 or less ATK from your Graveyard to your  hand.*

- This effect selects up to 3 targets. You can even target Gemini, Fusion, and Synchro monsters.
- If you have 4 Effect Monsters and 1 Normal Monster with 1500 ATK in your  Graveyard, you can activate this card and return the 1 Normal Monster to your hand.
- If you have 5 Normal Monsters in your Graveyard, you can activate "Backup Soldier" and chain a second "Backup Soldier"  before the first resolves, because the 5 monster requirement only needs  to be fulfilled at activation. This would allow you to put all 5  monsters in your hand, 3 with the first "Backup Soldier" and 2 with the  second.
- If your opponent activates "Delinquent Duo" and you  chain "Backup Soldier" with 2 pieces of Exodia and retrieve the other 3  from your Graveyard you win the Duel before you have to discard for  "Delinquent Duo". This is because you check for victory conditions in  between steps in a chain, (but not in between two separate effects of a  single card like "Graceful Charity").

#### BAD REACTION TO SIMOCHI

*As long as this card remains face-up on the field, any effect of  increasing your opponent's Life Points is changed to inflict the same  amount of points in damage to your opponent's Life Points.*

- The Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field. It does not activate.

- This effect is not cumulative. If you control 2 copies of "Bad Reaction to  Simochi" and your opponent activates "Dian Keto the Cure Master", they  only take 1000 points of damage [[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http:/entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)].

- VS. "Prime Material Dragon": if both "Bad Reaction to Simochi" and "Prime  Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin"  resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen  normally) [REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154).

  - These rules apply similarly to "Nurse Reficule the Fallen One" (erratum: Darklord Nurse Reficule).

- If you control this card on the field and activate "Rain of Mercy" (which  makes both players gain 1000 LP): you gain 1000 Life Points and your  opponent takes 1000 points of damage.

#### BAIT DOLL

*Force the activation of 1 face-down Trap Card. If the timing of the  activation of the Trap Card is incorrect, negate the effect and destroy  it. If it is not a Trap Card, it is returned to its original position.  After this card is activated, it is placed into the Deck (not the  Graveyard). Then shuffle the Deck.*

- You cannot activate this card if you cannot return cards to the Deck (by "G.B. Hunter").
- As long as the activation and effect of "Bait Doll" are not negated, the  effect of "Bait Doll" that shuffles it back into the Deck still  resolves.
- This effect targets 1 Set Spell / Trap card on the field.
  - The target can be chained if its activation requirement is met.
  - The target cannot be chained if it was just Set this turn (by "Dust Tornado").
  - If this card activates a Trap Card with a cost, and that Trap Card's  activation timing is correct, its owner must pay all possible costs. If  they cannot pay the costs, the Trap Card is negated and destroyed.
  - If "Bait Doll" targets a Set "Royal Oppression", the opponent can chain  the "Royal Oppression" which will negate the effect of "Bait Doll" (it  will not return to your Deck), or the opponent can allow "Bait Doll" to  force the activation of "Royal Oppression", and "Bait Doll" will then be shuffled into the Deck and "Royal Oppression" will remain active since  its activation timing was legitimate.
- If "Jinzo" is  face-up on the field and the effect of "Bait Doll" forces the activation of a Normal or Counter Trap Card, that Trap Card’s effect is negated  and the Trap Card is destroyed. If a Continuous Trap Card is forced to  activate by the effect of "Bait Doll" it will remain face-up on the  field meaninglessly until "Jinzo" is destroyed.
- If "Chain Burst" is active on the field and you use "Bait Doll" to activate the  opponent's Trap Card, and its timing is correct, the opponent takes the  1000 points of damage.
- When "Bait Doll" is activated, "Fake  Trap" cannot be activated because there is no guarantee that "Bait Doll" will destroy a Trap Card.

#### BALLISTA OF RAMPART SMASHING

*If the equipped monster attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, it gains 1500 ATK during damage calculation only.*

- This Continuous-like Effect increases the ATK in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
- "Ballista of Rampart Smashing" only increases the ATK for damage calculation,  then the increase disappears after the end of damage calculation.

#### BALLOON LIZARD

*(1) Put 1 counter on this card during each of your Standby Phases. (2) When this card is destroyed, inflict damage to the controller of the card  that destroyed it equal to the number of counters x 400 points.*

- The (1) Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
  - While "Skill Drain" is active, you can't put new counters on "Balloon Lizard".
  - The counters on "Balloon Lizard" are NOT Spell Counters.
  - Remove all counters on "Balloon Lizard" if it is flipped face-down or removed from the field.
- The (2) Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
  - If this card is destroyed by battle, this effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
  - You can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Balloon Lizard"'s effect.

#### BAMBOO SCRAP

*Tribute 1 Plant-Type monster. Special Summon 2 "Plant Tokens"  (Plant-Type/EARTH/Level 1/ATK 800/DEF 500) to your opponent's side of  the field in Defense Position.*

- Tributing 1 Plant-Type monster is a cost to activate this card.
- You can Tribute a face-down Plant-Type monster to activate this card.

#### BANISHER OF THE LIGHT

*(1) As long as this card remains face-up on the field, any card sent to the Graveyard is removed from play.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
  - If "Banisher of the Light" is destroyed, it will be sent to the Graveyard. If "Banisher of the Light" and other monsters are destroyed  simultaneously all monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
  - If "Don  Zaloog" battles an Attack Position "Banisher of the Light", Banisher is  marked as destroyed at the end of Substep 4 - Damage Calculation, but  its Continuous Effect still applies, so any card sent to the Graveyard  in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (by "Don Zaloog") will be  banished. Finally, in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, "Banisher of  the Light" is sent to the Graveyard.
  - "Kuriboh" and "Thunder Dragon" can be discarded from your hand and activated while "Banisher of the Light" is on the field.

#### BANNER OF COURAGE

*(1) During your Battle Phase, all monsters you control gain 200 ATK.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect does not start a Chain.
- Multiple copies of this card are cumulative.

#### BARK OF DARK RULER

*You can only activate this card during the Damage Step of a Battle Phase if a Fiend-Type monster on your side of the field battles. Pay Life Points (in multiples of 100 points) to decrease 1 of your opponent's monster's ATK and DEF by the same amount of points until End Phase of that turn.*

- This card targets your opponent’s monster that is battling your Fiend-Type monster.
- Paying Life Points for this card is a cost.
- You cannot pay more Life Points than necessary. This means that if the  target monster has ATK 1500 / DEF 1800, the highest amount of Life  Points you can pay is 1800. The target monster will then be an ATK 0 /  DEF 0. If the target monster has ATK 1850 / DEF 500, the most you can  pay is 1800. This is because you have to play in multiples of 100, and  paying 1900 would be paying more than necessary. So you may pay 1800  Life Points and the target monster would become an ATK 50 / DEF 0.

#### BARREL BEHIND THE DOOR

*Activate only when a card's effect that would inflict damage to you is activated. Your opponent takes the damage instead.*

- This card can only be Chained to an activated effect that inflicts damage to YOUR Life Points.
  - You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Jigen Bakudan". You  don’t activate "Barrel Behind the Door" when the Flip Effect activates,  you activate "Barrel Behind the Door" when "Jigen Bakudan" activates its effect during the next Standby Phase to inflict damage.
  - You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Ring of Destruction", and  then your opponent will take all of the damage (the damage inflicted to  him and the damage that would have been inflicted to you). The same is  true for "Tremendous Fire".
  - You can activate "Barrel Behind the  Door" against "Magic Cylinder". The attack will be negated and the  damage transferred to the opponent.
- VS. "Ceasefire":  You can't activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Ceasefire" if all  monsters on the field are face-down, or if all monsters on the field are face-up Normal Monsters, but you can activate it against "Ceasefire" if there is at least 1 face-up Effect Monster on the field.
- VS:  "Bad Reaction to Simochi": If "Bad Reaction to Simochi" is active, you  can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against effects that would  normally cause a Life Point increase, because they inflict damage  instead.
- This card can't be Chained to Life Point costs (ex:  "Wall of Revealing Light"), to effects that make you lose Life Points  (ex: "The Immortal of Thunder"), to effects that switch damage (like  another "Barrel Behind the Door") because they do not inflict damage,  they simply transfer it, to cards that do not inflict damage when the  card resolves (ex: "Graverobber"), nor to effects that aren't guaranteed to inflict Effect Damage (ex: "Time Wizard", "Ante").
- This card can't be Chained to a Continuous Spell / Trap Card, an Equip Spell Card, or a Field Spell Card.
  - Example: "Magical Thorn", "Dark Snake Syndrome", "Wave-Motion Cannon", or "Black Pendant".
- This card can't be Chained to Continuous Effects (ex: "Fire Princess") since they don't activate.

- A “Batteryman C” equipped to “Relinquished” is not in Attack or Defense  Position so it will not be counted for the effect of “Batteryman C”.
- If “Batteryman C” is changed to Machine-Type, it will itself gain the ATK bonus.

#### BATTERYMAN INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH

- Removing 1 Thunder-Type monster from play is a cost to activate this effect.
- "Batteryman Industrial Strength's" effect cannot be activated unless there is at  least 1 monster and at least 1 Spell or Trap Card on the field.
- If an effect is chained that removes one of the targets from the field, the remaining target is destroyed.

#### BATTERYMAN MICRO-CELL

- If "Batteryman Micro-Cell" is flipped face-up with "Ceasefire", etc., you  will still draw 1 card when it is destroyed in battle and sent to the  Graveyard.

#### BATTLE FADER

*(1) When  your opponent’s monster declares a direct attack, you can Special Summon this card from your hand and end the Battle Phase. (C) If this card is  Special Summoned with this effect, remove it from play when it is  removed from the field.*

- The (1) Trigger Effect activates during the first substep of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.

  - This effect to Special Summon can be negated by "Royal Oppression".

  - The Special Summon and ending the Battle Phase are all part of the effect  which activates and resolves in the hand. This effect is not negated by  "Skill Drain".

  - You cannot activate multiple copies of "Battle Fader" in response to a single attack declaration.

  - This effect has the same timing as cards like "Mirror Force".

    - Example: Player A declares a direct attack with "Light and Darkness Dragon"  while Player B has a set "Mirror Force" and a "Battle Fader" in hand.  Player B activates "Battle Fader’s" effect as Chain Link 1. Player A  activates "Light and Darkness Dragon’s" mandatory Trigger Effect as  Chain Link 2. Player B then activates "Mirror Force" as Chain Link 3.

  - This effect ends the Battle Step and moves players into the End Step of the Battle Phase [REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=804828).

    - "Gladiator Beasts" that have already battled (participated in Damage Calculation)  can still activate their effects during the End of the Battle Phase.

- The (C) Condition disappears when "Battle Fader" is flipped face-down.

#### BATTLE MANIA

- You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls no monsters.
- If your opponent controls a face-up Attack Position monster at the end of  their Main Phase 1, they must conduct their Battle Phase during the turn “Battle Mania” is activated.
- Monsters unaffected by Trap Cards, like “Elemental Hero Wildheart”, do not have to attack during the turn  “Battle Mania” is activated.
- During the Battle Phase of a turn  in which “Battle Mania” was activated, if your “Ultimate Tyranno”  attacks, but the attack is negated, it must still attack again if there  is another monster in play. (It cannot attack the same target twice.)

#### BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS

- “Battle of the Elements” can only be activated if there is at least 1 face-up monster on both sides of the field.

#### BATTLE TELEPORTATION

- This effect targets your face-up Psychic-Type monster.
- You can activate “Battle Teleportation” even if your opponent has no open  Monster Card Zones. If you do, the Psychic-Type monster is unable to  move to your opponent’s side of the field and is destroyed.
- You cannot activate “Battle Teleportation” if you cannot enter your Battle Phase.
- You can activate “Battle Teleportation” if your opponent has “Swords of  Revealing Light” face-up on the field because “Swords of Revealing  Light” only prevents you from declaring an attack.
- This card can target a monster that has already attacked.
- You can activate “Battle Teleportation” any time between your Draw Phase and the end of the Battle Phase.

#### BATTLE TUNED

- "Battle Tuned" targets 1 Tuner monster in your Graveyard.

*When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can  Special Summon 1 [Attribute or Type] monster with [specified ATK /  specified DEF / specified Level] in [Battle Position].*

- These optional Trigger Effects activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
- The "When... you can" structure means this effect can miss the timing.
- Because this effect activates / resolves in the Damage Step, it cannot be  negated by "Royal Oppression". Additionally, "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated in response to the Summon.
- These effects do not activate if the monster is removed from play (by "Dimensional Fissure").
- These effects do not activate if the monster is destroyed by a card effect (ex: "Red Dragon Archfiend").

#### BATTLE-SCARRED

- If the Archfiend targeted by "Battle-Scarred" is flipped face-down, then  the effect of "Battle-Scarred" disappears and "Battle-Scarred" remains  on the field meaninglessly.
- You can select an Archfiend that  doesn't require you to pay Life Points as a target for "Battle-Scarred"  (such as "Summoned Skull", "Archfiend Soldier", or "Fiend Skull  Dragon").
- When your opponent takes control of your Archfiend  targeted by "Battle-Scarred", then your opponent must pay the cost for  the Archfiend, and then pay the cost again because of "Battle-Scarred".
- When an Archfiend is equipped with "Heart of Clear Water", it is not  destroyed if it was targeted by "Battle-Scarred" and "Battle-Scarred" is removed from the field.
- If your opponent doesn't have enough  Life Points to pay for "Battle-Scarred", nothing happens to your  opponent, you must still pay for the cost of your Archfiend, and  "Battle-Scarred" remains on the field.
- If "Battle-Scarred" and "Pandemonium" are both active, neither player has to pay for Archfiend costs or for "Battle-Scarred".

#### BAZOO THE SOUL-EATER

- If you remove Monster Cards from your Graveyard to increase the ATK of  "Bazoo the Soul-Eater", then on your opponent’s turn he uses "Change of  Heart" to gain control of the same "Bazoo the Soul-Eater", your opponent can remove cards from his Graveyard to further increase the ATK. The  ATK increase you caused will end during that End Phase, and the ATK  increase your opponent caused will end during your End Phase.
- Removing Monster Cards from the Graveyard is a cost of "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"’s  effect, so if your opponent chains to the activation of this effect with "Call of the Haunted", to Special Summon "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer",  the effect of "Bazoo the Soul-Eater" is not negated since the Monster  Cards were already removed.

#### BEAST KING BARBAROS UR

- You can Normal Summon this card.
- If you equip “Fairy Meteor Crush” to your “Beast Machine King Barbaros Ür” and attack a Defense Position monster with lower DEF than this card’s  ATK, your opponent will not take Battle Damage.

- You can use "Beast Soul Swap" to return a non-Beast-Type monster on the  field that has been changed to Beast-Type with "DNA Surgery".
- This card targets the 1 face-up Beast-Type monster you returned to the hand.

#### BEASTKING OF THE SWAMPS

*(1) You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion-Material Monster. When  you do this, the other Fusion-Material Monster(s) must be the correct  one(s).*

- The (1) effect does not have any classification. It is not an Ignition, Trigger, Quick, or Continuous Effect.
  - This effect does not target.
  - Using "King of the Swamp" as a Fusion Material does not start a Chain Link.
  - The effect "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material  monster." of a monster like "King of the Swamp" is not applied while the monster is banished. If you activate "Parallel World Fusion", then you  cannot use it as a substitute for a Fusion Material.
  - The effect  "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster" of a  monster like "King of the Swamp" or "Goddess with the Third Eye" is not  applied while the monster is in the Deck.
  - When Special Summoning "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" or "XYZ-Dragon Cannon", you cannot send  to the Graveyard a monster like "The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion" as a  substitute for a Fusion Material.
  - If "King of the Swamp" is selected for the effect of "Prohibition", you cannot use either of its effects.

#### BECKONING LIGHT

*Discard all the cards in your hand, then select a number of LIGHT monsters in  your Graveyard equal to the number of cards you discarded, and add them  to your hand.*

- Discarding is not a cost.
- "Beckoning  Light" doesn't target. When you resolve "Beckoning Light", first  discard, then pick cards to add to your hand. So you can add cards to  your hand that you discarded while resolving "Beckoning Light".
- You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if you have no cards in your hand.
- You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if there are fewer LIGHT monsters in  your Graveyard than there are cards in your hand, even if 1 or more of  the cards in your hand are LIGHT monsters.
- You can activate  "Beckoning Light" while "Macro Cosmos" is active, but since no cards  will be discarded to the Graveyard, you CANNOT add any LIGHT monsters  from your Graveyard to your hand [[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=982726)].
- If "Disappear" is chained, and there are now fewer LIGHT monsters in your  Graveyard than cards in your hand, "Beckoning Light" resolves without  effect (you don't discard your hand or add cards to your hand).

#### BEGONE, KNAVE!

- If "Gemini Elf" attacks a Defense Position "Battle Footballer", and  "Gemini Elf"'s controller takes 200 damage, then "Begone, Knave!"'s  effect will send "Battle Footballer" back to its owner's hand.
- The effect of "Begone, Knave!" can be on a chain.
- The effect of "Begone, Knave!" is applied to the monster that inflicts  Battle Damage to the player, so if "Amazoness Swords Woman" battles a  stronger monster, "Amazoness Swords Woman" would normally be returned to the owner's hand, but because she is destroyed and sent to the  Graveyard, she will not be returned.

#### BEHEMOTH THE KING OF ALL ANIMALS

- It is possible to "properly" Tribute Summon "Behemoth the King of All  Animals" with just 1 Tribute. For example, you can Tribute Summon it  with "Trojan Horse", or use "Cost Down" and then Tribute 1 monster  because "Behemoth the King of All Animals" is only Level 5. In cases  such as this, either 2000 ATK or 2700 ATK is correct, so the controller  can select which ATK it will have.
- If "Trojan Horse" is Tributed to Tribute Summon "Behemoth the King of All Animals", you still only  return 1 monster from the Graveyard to your hand, because it’s the same  number as the number of monsters you Tributed to perform the Summon.
- If "Behemoth the King of All Animals" is Tribute Summoned with 2000 ATK,  and is then flipped face-down or removed from play temporarily, its ATK  becomes 2700 points when it is again face-up on the field.
- If  you Tribute Summon "Behemoth the King of All Animals" with 1 Tribute,  and "Skill Drain" is activated, its ATK becomes 2700 points. Even if  "Skill Drain" is destroyed, the ATK remains at 2700 points.
- If  you Tribute Set "Behemoth the King of All Animals" with 1 Tribute, its  ATK will only be 2000 points when flipped face-up. However, once it is  face-up, if it is flipped face-down again, the effect is reset and its  ATK becomes 2700 points.
- The second effect of "Behemoth the King of All Animals" is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to. It is a  targeting effect that targets a monster(s) in the Graveyard.
- If  you Tribute Summon this card with 1 Tribute and equip it with  "Megamorph", its current ATK will become 4000 or 1000, depending on Life Points.

#### BELIAL - MARQUIS OF DARKNESS

*(1) Your opponent cannot select any monster you control, except "Belial -  Marquis of Darkness", as an attack target, or as a target of a Spell or  Trap Card.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect applies so long as "Belial - Marquis of Darkness" is face-up on the field.
  - If a Spell / Trap Card targets 1 monster you control and you chain "Call  of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Belial - Marquis of Darkness", the  effect is still resolved as normal.
  - Monsters in your Graveyard can still be targeted by your opponent's Spell / Trap Cards.
  - This effect does not apply to face-down monsters you control [REF needed, errata'd in 2011].
- While the (1) Continuous Effect applies, your opponent can:
  - use Spell / Trap Cards which do not target (ex: "Bottomless Trap Hole", "Smashing Ground");
  - target your other monsters with monster effects (ex: "Caius the Shadow Monarch");
  - target your face-down Defense Position monsters with Spell / Trap Cards & Effects [REF needed, errata'd in 2011];
  - attack your face-down Defense Position monsters [REF needed, errata'd in 2011].
- If you control "Evil HERO Malicious Fiend" & "Belial - Marquis of  Darkness", and their effects are active, your opponent's monsters are  changed to Attack Position and must attack "Evil HERO Malicious Fiend".

#### BENDING DESTINY

- This card does not target. You can activate it during the Damage Step.  Returning the removed from play card to the hand does not start a Chain.

#### BERFOMET

- If “Berfomet” is not face-up on the field when its effect resolves, you  still add “Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts” to your hand.

#### BERSERK DRAGON

- "Berserk Dragon" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special  Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "A Deal with Dark Ruler". So "Berserk  Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if  Special Summoned properly first.
- If "Berserk Dragon" is removed  from play with "Interdimension Matter Transporter", you cannot try to  resolve "Berserk Dragon"'s effect before it returns to play; you must  return it to play first and then it loses 500 ATK.
- While "Skill  Drain" is active, "Berserk Dragon"'s effects are negated. But "Berserk  Dragon"'s effect doesn't count turns, so if "Skill Drain" was active for 4 turns, and is then destroyed, do not reduce "Berserk Dragon"'s ATK  for those 4 turns.

#### BERSERK GORILLA

- If a face-down "Berserk Gorilla" is attacked and flipped face-up, it's destroyed after damage calculation.
- If a face-down "Berserk Gorilla" is flipped face-up by "Swords of  Revealing Light", it's destroyed after resolving "Swords of Revealing  Light".
- "Berserk Gorilla" cannot attack if "Swords of Revealing Light", multiple "Marauding Captains", etc. are in play.
- If "Stumbling" and "Final Attack Orders" are both in play, and "Berserk  Gorilla" is Summoned, "Berserk Gorilla" is destroyed when it is changed  to Defense Position by "Stumbling".
- If "Final Attack Orders" and "Berserk Gorilla" are both on the field, and the opponent targets  "Berserk Gorilla" with "Ring of Destruction", and you chain "Zero  Gravity", "Berserk Gorilla" is destroyed in the middle of the chain due  to "Zero Gravity"'s effect, and "Ring of Destruction"'s effect  disappears.
- If you control "Berserk Gorilla" and another  monster, "Berserk Gorilla" doesn't have to be the first monster you  attack with, you can attack with other monsters first, as long as you do attack with "Berserk Gorilla".
- If "The Dark Door" is active and you control "Berserk Gorilla" and another monster, you can choose for  your other monster to be the 1 monster that attacks.
- If you  control “Berserk Gorilla” you must enter your Battle Phase, even if  “Gravity Bind” is active on the field, preventing it from attacking.

#### BIG BANG SHOT

- When the monster equipped with "Big Bang Shot" is destroyed, and "Big Bang  Shot" is destroyed as a result of this, the equipped monster is not  removed from play.
- The effect of "Big Bang Shot" that removes  the equipped monster from play can be resolved between steps of a chain. For example, if "Change of Heart" targets a monster equipped with "Big  Bang Shot", and "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained to "Change of Heart" to destroy "Big Bang Shot", first resolve "Mystical Space Typhoon" and  destroy "Big Bang Shot", then remove the monster that was equipped from  play, and THEN resolve "Change of Heart" (and the effect of "Change of  Heart" disappears).
- If a monster equipped with "Big Bang Shot"  is flipped face-down, it is no longer a target of "Big Bang Shot" so  "Big Bang Shot" is sent to the Graveyard and the monster is not removed  from play.
- When "Imperial Order" is active, and you destroy "Big Bang Shot" with "Dust Tornado", the effect of "Big Bang Shot" that  would remove the monster from play is NOT applied.
- When you send "Big Bang Shot" to the Graveyard with "Emergency Provisions", the monster is removed from play at the same time.
- When equipped to "Guardian Ceal", if you send "Big Bang Shot" to the  Graveyard as a cost for "Guardian Ceal"'s effect, "Guardian Ceal" is  removed from play but "Guardian Ceal"'s effect still resolves.
- If a monster is equipped with "Big Bang Shot" and "Fiber Jar" is  activated, both "Big Bang Shot" and the equipped monster are shuffled  into the Deck, and the equipped monster is not removed from play even  though "Big Bang Shot" was removed from the field.
- If you equip  your "Big Bang Shot" to your opponent's "Dark Magician", and "Dark  Magician" attacks your "Giant Soldier of Stone", the opponent of the  owner of the "Big Bang Shot" takes the damage (so your opponent, who  attacked with "Dark Magician", takes 900 points of damage.)
- The  battle damage caused when the equipped monster attacks a Defense  Position monster is considered to come from the equipped monster, not  from "Big Bang Shot". So a "Don Zaloog" equipped with "Big Bang Shot"  could still make the opponent discard 1 card when attacking a face-down  monster with low DEF.
- If you Special Summon a monster with  "Premature Burial", and equip it with "Big Bang Shot", and "Heavy Storm" is activated, the effects of "Premature Burial" and "Big Bang Shot"  form a chain, with the controller of the 2 cards determining the order  in which they are placed on the chain, and the order in which they are  resolved. If the controller chooses "Big Bang Shot" to be Step 2, then  the monster will be removed from play. If the controller chooses  "Premature Burial" to be Step 2, then the monster will be destroyed and  sent to the Graveyard.

#### BIG BURN

- You can only activate "Big Burn" when an EFFECT that removes monsters in  the Graveyard is activated. So you can't activate "Big Burn" when a  player removes monsters in the Graveyard as a COST to Special Summon  "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning", "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", or to activate the effect of "Strike Ninja" or  "Freed the Brave Wanderer". Nor can you use "Big Burn" when monsters are removed for a condition.
- "Big Burn"'s effect is negated if "Necrovalley" is active.
- You can chain "Big Burn" to effects like "Disappear", "The Shallow Grave", or "Spear Cretin".
- You can't activate "Big Burn" when "Sinister Serpent" activates in the Graveyard, because "Sinister Serpent" doesn't target.
- When "Spirit Elimination" is activated and "Big Burn" is chained, the player who activated "Spirit Elimination" removes all monsters on his side of  the field. The other player removes all monsters in the Graveyard as  usual.

#### BIG SHIELD GARDNA

- A  face-down "Big Shield Gardna" can only negate a Spell Card that targets 1 face-down monster, so it cannot negate "Riryoku", "Creature Swap" or  "Dark Hole", but could negate "Nobleman of Crossout" or "Tribute to the  Doomed".
- If "Big Shield Gardna" is targeted with a Spell Card,  you may chain "Book of Moon" to flip it face-down, then it can negate  the Spell Card and will flip back to face-up Defense Position.
- "Skill Drain" only negates the effects of monsters that are face-up on the  field, so a face-down "Big Shield Gardna" may still negate a Spell Card  that targets it while "Skill Drain" is active on the field. It will  still be flipped to face-up Defense Position, and now its effect that  changes its battle position when it is attacked will be negated.
- If "Prickle Fairy" attacks a face-down "Big Shield Gardna" both their  effects will occur at the end of the Damage Step. "Prickle Fairy" will  be Step 1 and "Big Shield Gardna" Step 2. So it will change to Attack  Position, and then the effect of "Prickle Fairy" will change it back to  Defense Position.

#### BIG WAVE SMALL WAVE

- You can Special Summon high-level WATER monsters with "Big Wave Small  Wave", like "Levia-Dragon - Daedalus", "Suijin", or "Gogiga Gagagigo".
- You cannot use "Big Wave Small Wave" to Summon "Special Summon-only" WATER monsters like "Aqua Spirit" or "Fenrir".
- You cannot activate "Big Wave Small Wave" when there are no WATER monsters on your side of the field.
- "The Legendary Fisherman" is not destroyed by the effect of "Big Wave Small  Wave" if "Umi" is on the field, so he remains on the field.
- After destroying WATER monsters with "Big Wave Small Wave" you can choose not to Special Summon any WATER monsters if you wish.

#### BIG-TUSKED MAMMOTH

- The effect of “Big-Tusked Mammoth” includes those monsters Summoned this  turn before “Big-Tusked Mammoth” was face-up on the field. For example,  if your opponent attacks with a monster that was Summoned this turn, and you activate “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Big-Tusked  Mammoth” from the Graveyard, this causes a replay, and your opponent now cannot attack with the monster that was Summoned this turn.
- If  “Big-Tusked Mammoth” is Set on the field, and is attacked by a monster  that was Summoned this turn, the attack resolves normally.
- Monsters flipped face-up with an effect like “Book of Taiyou” are not affected by “Big-Tusked Mammoth” and can attack that turn.
- If “Big-Tusked Mammoth” is on the field, and a monster that was Summoned  this turn is removed from play temporarily and returns to the field the  same turn, it still cannot attack.

#### BLACK BRUTDRAGO

*1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner Gemini monsters
(1) Once per turn, you can send 1 Gemini monster from your hand to the  Graveyard to select and destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card your opponent  controls. (2) When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can select 1 Gemini monster in your Graveyard and Special Summon it.  The Special Summoned Gemini monster is treated as an Effect Monster, and gains its effect.* 

- If you use "[Eccentric Boy](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Eccentric_Boy)" to Synchro Summon "Black Brutdrago", you must send a Gemini monster  from your hand to the Graveyard as a Synchro Material Monster.
- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - Sending 1 Gemini monster from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost. This effect cannot be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" is active.
  - This effect targets 1 Spell / Trap Card (face-up / face-down) your opponent controls.
- The (2) optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
  - This effect targets 1 Gemini monster in your Graveyard.
  - This effect will can activate even during the Damage Step.

#### BLACK GARDEN

*(1) When a monster is Normal or Special Summoned, except by the effect of  “Black Garden”, halve its ATK and Special Summon 1 “Rose Token”  (Plant-Type/DARK/Level 2/ATK 800/DEF 800) to its controller’s opponent’s side of the field, in Attack Position. (2) You can destroy this card  and all face-up Plant-Type monsters on the field and Special Summon 1  monster with ATK equal to the total ATK of those monsters from your  Graveyard.*

- The (1) mandatory Trigger-like Effect CANNOT miss the timing.
  - Player A performs a Normal Summon, causing "Black Garden" to activate. Player A chooses which Zone the "Rose Token" is Summoned to, and is considered  its *owner* (for "Remove Brainwashing").
  - This effect  activates in response to Normal and Special Summons (including when a  monster is Special Summoned face-down), not Flip Summons.
  - This  effect activates even if the Summmoned monster is unaffected by the  effects of Spell Cards, its ATK will not be halved, but a "Rose Token"  is still Special Summoned.
  - This effect activates even if a  player cannot Special Summon a "Rose Token" (by "Vanity's Fiend" or  while their opponent's Monster Card Zones are full), halving the ATK of  the Summoned monster(s).
  - This effect activates once when  multiple monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously. It will halve the ATK of each of those monsters and Summon a single "Rose Token".
    - "The Shallow Grave" causes both players to Special Summon a monster(s)  simultaneously, and thus each player will also Special Summon 1 "Rose  Token".
  - This effect activates multiple times if  multiple monsters are Normal / Special Summoned sequentially in a chain  (ex: "Ultimate Offering"). It will halve the ATK of each of those  monsters and Summon 1 "Rose Token".
  - The ATK change applies while that monster is face-up, even if "Black Garden" leaves the field.
  - An affected monster equipped with "Megamorph": its ATK will be double its original ATK.
  - If a monster with "? ATK" (ex: "Tragoedia") is Normal / Special Summoned:  first determine its original ATK, then halve it by "Black Garden's"  effect. That monster's ATK will not change.
  - If "Black Garden"  and "The Wicked Dreadroot" are face-up on the field: when a monster is  Normal or Special Summoned, its ATK is first halved by "The Wicked  Dreadroot", and halved again afterwards when "Black Garden's" effect  resolves.
- VS. "Torrential Tribute": If chained to the  effect of "Black Garden", no "Rose Token" will be Summoned because the  Normal / Special Summoned monster cannot have its ATK halved [[REF1](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forum:Black_Garden_vs._torrential/bottomless), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=659951)].
- VS. "Summon Limit": Player A Normal Summons a monster while Player B  controls "Black Garden" and "Summon Limit". The "Rose Token" is  considered Summoned by Player B's card effect, so Player A can Summon  one more time that turn [[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=635623)].
- VS. "Scapegoat": Player A controls "Black Garden" and activates  "Scapegoat". The effect of "Black Garden" activates after the "Sheep  Tokens" are Special Summoned, no "Rose Token" is Summoned since Player A cannot Special Summon. If Player A activates "Scapegoat" while Player B controls "Black Garden", "Black Garden" activates and Special Summons a "Rose Token" after "Scapegoat" resolves.
- The (2) Ignition-like Effect targets a monster in the Graveyard at activation.
  - You CANNOT activate this effect while there are no Plant-Type monsters on the field.
  - You CANNOT activate this effect while "Black Garden" cannot be destroyed (ex: "Field Barrier").
  - This effect can target a monster with 0 ATK so long as the total ATK of all  Plant-Type monsters on the field (minimum 1) is also zero [[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=709167)].
  - "Black Garden" AND all face-up Plant-Type monsters are destroyed at resolution. This is not a cost.
  - This effect resolves sequentially. "Black Garden" AND 1(+) Plant-Type  monster(s) must be destroyed by this effect to Summon the target.
  - If "Black Garden" is destroyed before resolving this effect, no Plant-Type monsters are destroyed and the target remains in the Graveyard.
  - If the total ATK of all Plant-Type monsters (+ ATK modifiers) is not the  same as the ATK of the target, the target is not Summoned (you still  destroy "Black Garden" and all Plant-Type monsters).
- "Royal Oppression" CANNOT be activated when "Black Garden" is activated (played face-up).
  - "Royal Oppression" (and its effect) can chain to either of "Black Garden's" effects.

#### BLACK HORN OF HEAVEN

- Like “Horn of Heaven”, this card cannot be used against “Premature Burial”,  etc. It can be used against inherent Special Summon effects like “Cyber  Dragon” or “Dark Necrofear”.
- You cannot activate “Black Horn of Heaven” when you Special Summon “Lava Golem” onto your opponent’s side of the field.

#### BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER - ENVOY OF THE BEGINNING

- "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" is treated as a different card from "Black Luster Soldier". So you can have 3 copies of "Black Luster  Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" and 3 copies of "Black Luster Soldier" in your Deck & Side Deck combined.
- "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" can remove itself from play using its first effect.
- The first effect of "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" can be  activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2. The second effect can be  activated during your Damage Step in your Battle Phase, and can be  chained to.
- If you activate "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"'s first effect, and "Skill Drain" is chained to it to negate the effect, or if "Skill Drain" was active before you activated the  effect, you cannot attack with "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the  Beginning" that turn because the activation of the effect was not  negated and the condition that is included will not be negated by "Skill Drain".
- If you use the first effect of "Black Luster Soldier -  Envoy of the Beginning", then remove him from play and return him to  play, or destroy him and Special Summon him again, or flip him face-down then face-up again, you can activate his effect again that same turn.
- If "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" attacks, and its attack is negated by "Magic Cylinder" or "Negate Attack", you cannot activate  his first effect during Main Phase 2.
- When a card is removed  from play by "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"'s first  effect, it is removed from play face-up.
- If "Black Luster  Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" destroys your opponent's only monster  with his first attack, he can attack your opponent directly for the  second attack.
- If "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the  Beginning" attacks and destroys your opponent's monster, then attacks a  second time and destroys another monster, it does not get to attack any  more that turn.
- Even if you equip him with "Twin Swords of  Flashing Light - Tryce", "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" only gets a maximum of 2 attacks.
- When "Black Luster Soldier -  Envoy of the Beginning" conducts a second attack using his second  effect, his effect activates during the first attack's Damage Step, and  the attack is declared in the next Battle Step. The second attack must  come consecutively after the first attack; other monsters' attacks  cannot come in-between.

#### BLACK PENDANT

- If this card is destroyed while face-down, it still does damage to your opponent.
- If this card’s activation is negated, such as with "Magic Jammer" or "Riryoku Field" it does not do damage to your opponent.
- "Black Pendant" activates in the Graveyard, so if it is destroyed when  "Imperial Order" is on the field, it still does damage to your opponent.
- You can chain to the activation of the effect of "Black Pendant" when it is sent to the Graveyard.

#### BLACK POTAN

- If “Black Potan” is removed from the field while being treated as a Tuner, you do not gain any Life Points.
- If a Monster Token being treated as a Tuner is removed from the field, you gain Life Points.
- If a Tuner monster that is equipped to “Relinquished” is removed from the  field, you do not gain Life Points because it was not being treated as a monster.

#### BLACK ROSE DRAGON

*(1)  When this card is Synchro Summoned, you can destroy all cards on the  field. (2) Once per turn, you can remove from play 1 Plant-Type monster  from your Graveyard to change 1 Defense Position monster your opponent  controls to face-up Attack Position, and reduce its ATK to 0 until the  End Phase.*

- The (1) optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
  - If "Black Rose Dragon" activates its first effect, it is also destroyed.
- The (2) Ignition Effect targets 1 Defense Position monster your opponent controls.
  - Removing 1 Plant-Type monster in your Graveyard from play is a cost.
  - If the target is not changed to Attack Position by this effect, its ATK is not reduced to 0.
  - If the target is in face-down Defense Position, its Flip Effect will activate after this effect resolves.
  - A monster whose ATK was changed to 0 can have its ATK increased by cards/effects.
    - The change is applied to 0 ATK.

#### BLACK SALVO

*When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 DARK  Machine-Type monster from your Graveyard in face-up Defense Position.  Its effect(s) is negated.*

- This is a Trigger Effect that  targets the appropriate monster in your Graveyard. Once the target is  Summoned, it is no longer targeted by this card.

#### BLACK TYRANNO

- If there is a Spell or Trap Card on your opponent's side of the field, "Black Tyranno" cannot attack directly.
- If there is an Attack Position monster on your opponent's side of the field, "Black Tyranno" cannot attack directly.
- If your opponent has only Defense Position monsters on his side of the  field, "Black Tyranno" can attack directly even if some are face-down.
- If an effect resolves during the Battle Step of "Black Tyranno"'s direct  attack that results in a Spell Card, Trap Card, or Attack Position  monster being on your opponent's side of the field, a replay occurs.
- If your opponent's only monster is in face-up Defense Position, but it is  equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", "Black Tyranno" must attack that  monster if "Black Tyranno" attacks.

#### BLACK WHIRLWIND

*When a “Blackwing” monster is Normal Summoned to your side of the Field, you can add 1 “Blackwing” monster from your Deck to your hand that has less ATK than that monster.*

- This optional Trigger-like Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
- Both "Black Whirlwind" and the Normal Summoned "Blackwing" monster must be face-up on the field.
- This effect still resolves if control of the "Blackwing" monster changes during the chain.
- The ATK (+ATK modifiers) of the "Blackwing" monster is assessed when resolving this effect.
- A chain can be built if multiple copies of "Black Whirlwing" were triggered simultaneously.

#### BLACKWING - ARMED WING

- If “Blackwing Armed Wing” attacks a Defense Position monster, and that  monster is changed to Attack Position before the Damage Step, it does  not gain 500 ATK.

#### BLACKWING - ARMOR MASTER

*(1) This card cannot be destroyed by battle, and you take no Battle Damage  from battles involving this card. (2) If this card attacks a monster,  you can place 1 Wedge Counter on that monster at the end of the Damage  Step (max. 1). (3) You can remove all Wedge Counters from your  opponent's monsters to reduce the ATK and DEF of each monster that had a Wedge Counter to 0, until the End Phase.*

- This (1) Continuous Effect can be negated by "Skill Drain".
- The (2) optional Trigger Effect places a "Wedge Counter" on a monster that  battled Amor Master during Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (when  monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard).
  - This effect does not target the monster battling Armor Master.
  - "Wedge Counters" fall off a monster if it is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
- The (3) Ignition Effect removes all "Wedge Counters" from the field as cost.
  - The ATK / DEF changes are reset when that monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field.

#### BLACKWING - BLIZZARD THE FAR NORTH

- The restriction against Special Summoning “Blackwing – Blizzard the Far  North” is not an ‘effect’. The effect of “Blackwing – Blizzard the Far  North” targets 1 “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard.

#### BLACKWING - ELPHIN THE RAVEN

- The Trigger Effect of “Blackwing – Elphin the Raven” targets the opponent’s monster.
- You can target a face-down monster with “Blackwing – Elphin the Raven” and flip it to face-up Attack Position.
- If the monster has a Flip Effect, it will activate.

#### BLACKWING - FANE THE STEEL CHAIN

- This effect targets the Attack Position monster.

#### BLACKWING - GALE THE WHIRLWIND

*(S) If you control a “Blackwing” monster other than “Blackwing – Gale the  Whirlwind”, you can Special Summon this card from your hand.*
(1) Once per turn, you can halve the ATK and DEF of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.

- This (S) Special Summon does not start a chain.

- The (1) Ignition Effect targets. The target’s ATK is halved so long as it remains face-up on the field.

  - Non-Continuous Effects (such as Gale's) that halve ATK/DEF calculated by a Continuous  Effect (such as "Tragoedia's") prevent the Continuous Effect from  recalculating. This locks the new ATK/DEF of that monster so long as it  is face-up on the field ~~[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/105886-tragoedia-being-summoned-while-black-garden-is-active/&tab=comments#comment-2112568)~~

    - Example 1: A monster equipped with “United We Stand” whose ATK was halved by  Gale WILL NOT have its ATK changed when the number of monsters on the  field changes.
    - Example 2: Gale's effect targets a "Blue-Eyes  White Dragon" equipped with "Axe of Despair". Its ATK is reduced to  2000, and will not change even if "Axe of Despair" is destroyed or has  its effect negated. This ruling also applies to temporary ATK modifiers  (ex: "Rush Recklessly").

#### BLACKWING - KALUT THE MOON SHADOW

*When a "Blackwing" monster you control attacks or is attacked, you can send  this card from your hand to the Graveyard during the Damage Step to have that monster gain 1400 ATK until the End Phase.*

- Sending “Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow” to the graveyard is a cost to activate its effect.
- The effect of “Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow” does not target.
- You can send “Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow” to the Graveyard during either player’s turn, as it is a Quick Effect.
- This effect CAN be activated in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation of the Damage Step.

#### BLACKWING - MISTRAL THE SILVER SHIELD

- This is a Trigger Effect that activates when this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
- Reducing the[ Battle Damage](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Battle_Damage) to 0 does not start a Chain.


**BLACKWING - SIROCCO THE DAWN**
*(U) If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you  can Normal Summon or Set this card without Tributing. (1) Once per turn, you can select 1 face-up "Blackwing" monster you control. It gains ATK  equal to the total ATK of all face-up "Blackwing" monsters on the field  except itself. (C) Monsters other than the selected monster cannot  attack the turn you activate this effect.*

- The (U) Unclassified Effect allows this monsster to be Normal Summoned / Set without Tribute.
  - This effect does not activate.
- The (1) Ignition Effect targets 1 "Blackwing" monster you control (including itself).
  - This effect CANNOT be activated during your Main Phase 2.
  - Your opponent’s “Blackwing” monsters are also counted towards the ATK gain.
  - The ATK boost lasts until the End Phase.
- The (C) Condition applies so long as the activation of the (1) Ignition Effect was not negated.
  - Monsters Summoned after this effect resolved cannot attack this turn.
  - If the targeted monster is no longer on the field when the effect  resolves, all your other monsters still cannot attack this turn.
  - If the activation of the effect of “Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn” is negated, then your other monsters may attack this turn.
  - If you have 2 copies of “Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn” and target 2  different monsters with them, neither of those monsters can attack this  turn.
  - If “Skill Drain” is activated after the effect of  “Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn” resolves, then the effect is not negated. The ATK boost remains, and the other monsters cannot attack this turn.


**BLACKWING - SHURA THE BLUE FLAME**
*(1) When this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 "Blackwing" monster with 1500  or less ATK from your Deck. That monster's effect(s) is negated.*

- The (1) optional Trigger Effect activates at the start of Substep 7 - End  of the Damage Step (when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the  Graveyard) of the Damage Step.
  - This effect only activates if Shura is face-up on the field (ex: "Goyo Guardian" and [MANY MORE](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=7967783)).
  - This effect will form a chain (as per SEGOC) with and other cards / effect  that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (ex: "Michizure",  "Legendary Jujitsu Master").
- This (1) optional Trigger Effect will NOT activate if:
  - Shura battled a monster with equal ATK and both were destroyed.
  - Shura was removed from the field by the effect of "D.D. Warrior Lady".
  - Shura was removed from the field by a Flip Effect (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" or "Penguin Soldier").
- The Special Summoned monster's effect(s) is negated so long as it remains face-up on the field.
- "Torrential Tribute" and "Royal Oppression" CANNOT be activated at any point in the Damage Step.


**BLACKWING - SILVERWIND THE ASCENDENT**
*(1) When this card is Synchro Summoned, you can select and destroy up to 2  face-up monsters on the field with DEF lower than this card's ATK. (C)  You cannot conduct your Battle Phase the turn you activate this effect.  (2) The next time a "Blackwing" monster you control would be destroyed  by battle during your opponent's turn, it is not destroyed, this effect  only happens once.*

- You can Special Summon this monster with  the effect of “Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor." You must remove  from play a Level 7 “Blackwing” monster alongside Vayu to do so.
- The (1) optional Trigger Effect can only be activated when this monster is Synchro Summoned.
  - This effect does NOT activate when Special Summoned by "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor".
  - You can activate this effect even if “Skill Drain” is active. However, the  (C) Condition will still apply, and you will not be able to conduct your Battle Phase, even though the effect was negated.
  - If a monster targeted by this effect gains more DEF than Silverwind’s ATK, it will not be destroyed.
  - If a monster targeted by this effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed. Any remaining face-up targets will be destroyed.
  - If this card is flipped face-down its ATK cannot be verified, so no monsters will be destroyed.
- The (2) Continuous Effect does not start a chain. You don’t choose when to use the “*next time a “Blackwing” monster would be destroyed by battle*” effect. It is automatically applied the next time your “Blackwing”  monster would be destroyed by battle during your opponent’s turn.

#### BLACKWING - VAYU THE EMBLEM OF HONOR

*(1) If this card is face-up on the field, you cannot use it for a Synchro  Summon. (2) If this card is in your Graveyard, you can remove from play  this card plus 1 non-Tuner “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard, and  Special Summon 1 “Blackwing” Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck whose  Level equals the total Levels of the removed monsters. The effect(s) of  that Synchro Monster is negated.*

- The (1) Continuous Effect CAN be negated (by "Skill Drain" or if Vayu is Special Summoned by Shura).
- The (2) Ignition Effect targets a "Blackwing" Monster in your Graveyard.
  - Vayu + 1 non-Tuner "Blackwing" monster are removed from play when this effect resolves. This is not a cost.
  - Both monsters must be removed from play by Vayu’s effect to perform the Special Summon.
    - Example: Player A activates Vayu's effect targeting Sirocco in their Graveyard.  Player B chains "D.D. Crow" and targets that same Sirocco. When the  chain resolves, Vayu could not remove both itself and its target from  play in the Graveyard. Thus, Player A's Vayu is not remove from play,  and no "Blackwing" Synchro monster is Special Summoned.
  - This effect does not perform a Synchro Summon. It can be activated while "Discord" is active.
  - Since the monster was not properly Synchro Summoned, it cannot be Special  Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play (ex: "Call of the  Haunted", "Return from the Different Dimension").

#### BLADE KNIGHT

- If you control "Blade Knight" and a face-down monster on your side of the  field, "Blade Knight"’s second effect is not applied because you control another monster (whether it is face-up or face-down is not important).
- If you have two "Blade Knights", then their second effects are not applied because for each one, you have another monster on the field besides the "Blade Knight".
- If "Blade Knight" destroys a Flip Effect  Monster like "Slate Warrior", even that monster’s non-Flip effects are  negated. So in this case, "Slate Warrior" does not reduce the ATK and  DEF of the "Blade Knight" that destroyed it, because "Blade Knight"  negates its effect.
- If "Blade Knight" destroys "The Immortal of  Thunder", its effect is negated. If your opponent had already gained the 3000 Life Points, then your opponent does not lose the 5000 Life  Points. If "Blade Knight" attacked "The Immortal of Thunder" while it  was face-down, your opponent neither gains nor loses Life Points from  "The Immortal of Thunder"’s effect.
- If "Blade Knight" destroys "Spear Cretin", "Spear Cretin"’s effect is not applied.
- The effect of a Flip Effect monster destroyed by "Blade Knight" is negated  while the destroyed card is in the Graveyard. If the monster is Set  again on the field, then the Flip Effect is activated when it’s flipped  again.
- If "Blade Knight" attacks a face-down Attack Position  Flip Effect Monster with equal ATK, and both monsters are destroyed,  then "Blade Knight"’s effect is applied because it destroyed the  monster, and the monster’s effect is negated.

#### BLAST ASMODIAN

- If you activate “Call of the Haunted” targeting “Blast Asmodian”, then  another card is chained to “Call of the Haunted”, the effect of “Blast  Asmodian” does not activate and inflict damage after the chain resolves.
- Only Spell and Trap Card activations will activate the effect of “Blast  Asmodian”. Effects that may activate from previously-activated Spell and Trap Cards are not taken into account.
- "Blast Asmodian's"  effect is a Trigger Effect. When it activates you can chain the  activation of a Spell or Trap Card. After that chain resolves, "Blast  Asmodian's" effect will Trigger again, and start a new chain.

#### BLAST HELD BY A TRIBUTE

- When your opponent attacks with a monster that you Tribute Summoned, and  your opponent took control of, you can activate "Blast Held by a  Tribute".
- Monsters like "Tyrant Dragon" cannot negate the effect of "Blast Held by a Tribute".
- In order to inflict 1000 points of damage to your opponent, you must  destroy all monsters on your opponent's side of the field first. So if  you activate "Blast Held by a Tribute", and your opponent chains "Ring  of Destruction" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" so that your  opponent has no monsters to destroy, then "Blast Held by a Tribute"  inflicts no damage.

#### BLAST JUGGLER

- "Blast Juggler" targets 2 face-up monsters with 1000 or less ATK.
- "Blast Juggler's" effect cannot be activated if there is only 1 face-up  monster (excluding "Blast Juggler") with 1000 or less ATK.

#### BLAST MAGICIAN

- If "Rush Recklessly" is chained to the effect of "Blast Magician", and the ATK of the target monster is now higher than 700 x the number of Spell  Counters removed, the effect of "Blast Magician" disappears. You cannot  remove additional Spell Counters to increase the effect.
- This is an effect that targets.
- You must remove at least 1 Spell Counter. You cannot activate the effect and remove zero Spell Counters.
- You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if  "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is  chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this  monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust  Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was  not negated.
- "Blast Magician" must have been face-up on the  field when the Spell Card was activated (and when it resolves) in order  to receive a Spell Counter.

#### BLAST WITH CHAIN

- This card targets 1 monster.
- If you use "Emergency Provisions", it sends Spell & Trap Cards to the  Graveyard, it does not destroy them, so if you send this card to the  Graveyard with "Emergency Provisions", this card's effect will not be  activated. The same applies to "Woodland Sprite".
- If you equip  this card to "Gearfried the Iron Knight", then this card's effect will  be activated because it was destroyed by a card effect.
- When  this card is negated by "Solemn Judgment" or "7 Tools of the Bandit",  this card is negated and destroyed and the effect does NOT activate.
- You can activate this card during the Damage Step because it specifically modifies ATK.
- You cannot target Tyrant Dragon with this card and if you attempt to, then  this card is negated and destroyed, and you do NOT get the effect of  this card.
- If a monster attacks "Gearfried the Iron Knight", and you activate "Blast with Chain" during the Damage Step, "Blast With  Chain" is destroyed and gets its effect, so you can destroy the  attacking monster before Damage Calculation.
- If your opponent  activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" targeting your face-down "Blast with  Chain", and you chain "Blast with Chain", you still get "Blast with  Chain's" effect.
- If this card is destroyed in the middle of a resolving chain, its effect will start a new chain after current one resolves.

#### BLASTING FUSE

- The effect of “Blasting Fuse” also destroys itself.
- Even if an effect is chained to “Blasting Fuse” that removes 1 of the cards  in that column, the effect is still applied and all remaining cards in  the column are destroyed.

#### BLASTING THE RUINS

- Even if you activate "Blasting the Ruins" and an effect is chained that  reduces your Graveyard to less than 30 cards, "Blasting the Ruins" still resolves because the condition was correct at the time of activation.

#### BLAZE ACCELERATOR

*(1) You can send 1 Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK from your hand to the Graveyard to destroy 1 monster your opponent controls, (C) but you  cannot declare an attack during this turn if you do.*

- The (1) Ignition-like Effect targets.

  - If the target is not on the field, you must still send a Pyro-Type Monster to the Graveyard.
  - You cannot activate this effect unless you have a Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK in hand.
  - You cannot activate this effect simultaneously with this card’s activation.
  - You can only activate the effect after this card’s activation is resolved, and it is face-up on the field.

- Sending 1 Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK to the Graveyard is part of the (1) effect.

  - It is not a cost [[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=855510)].
  - This effect can be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" is face-up on the  field. The Pyro-Type Monster sent to the Graveyard is removed from play  instead.

- The (C) Condition prevents you from attacking during the turn the (1) effect was activated [REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=855510).

  - This applies even if the (1) effect failed to destroy the target.
  - This applies even if a card/effect is chained to the (1) effect that destroys "Blaze Accelerator".
  - This applies to monster unaffected by Spell Cards / Effects (ex: "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6").

#### BLAZEWING BUTTERFLY

*(U) This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or  in the Graveyard. (C) While this card is face-up on the field, you can  Normal Summon it to have it be treated as an Effect Monster with this  effect:
● (1) You can Tribute this card to Special Summon 1 Gemini  monster from your Graveyard, except "Blazewing Butterfly". A Gemini  monster Special Summoned by this effect is treated as an Effect Monster, and gains its effect.*

- The (U) Unclassified Effect applies on the field and in the Graveyard.
  - This effect can be negated while "Blazewing Butterfly" is face-up on the field, causing it to be treated as an effect monster.
- The (C) Condition cannot be negated. This is not an effect.
- The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
  - This effect targets a Gemini monster in your Graveyard. It will be negated by "Necrovalley".

#### BLAZING HIITA

- This card’s effect is an Ignition Effect.

- If a monster Special Summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed when this card is destroyed.

#### BLIND DESTRUCTION

- Rolling a die is not optional, you must roll one each of your Standby Phases.  If you have two copies of "Blind Destruction" active on the field you  roll two dice each of your Standby Phases.

#### BLINDLY LOYAL GOBLIN

- If your opponent takes control of your "Blindly Loyal Goblin" with "Change of Heart" and flips it face-up, control of the monster does not return  to you.
- If you Special Summon your opponent's "Blindly Loyal  Goblin" with "Monster Reborn", and "Remove Brainwashing" is activated,  control of "Blindly Loyal Goblin" does not return to your opponent.
- Your opponent cannot use "Change of Heart", "Snatch Steal", or "Brain Control" on your face-up "Blindly Loyal Goblin".
- Neither player can activate "Creature Swap" if the only monster you control is  "Blindly Loyal Goblin". If you control "Blindly Loyal Goblin" and 1  other monster when "Creature Swap" is activated, you must select the  other monster.
- If your opponent tries to use "Change of Heart"  on your face-down "Blindly Loyal Goblin", and you chain "Ceasefire" to  flip it face-up, the effect of "Change of Heart" is negated.
- Your opponent cannot target your "Blindly Loyal Goblin" with the effect of "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict".

#### BLOCKMAN

- "Blockman's" effect only counts the number of your turns. The turn you Summon "Blockman" is the first turn.

#### BLOWBACK DRAGON

- "Blowback Dragon"'s effect does target. The target is the selected card.

If the  monster destroyed in battle by "Blue Thunder T-45" is removed from play  by "Dimensional Fissure", etc., "Blue Thunder T-45's" effect still  activates.
- If "Blue Thunder T-45" is destroyed by a card effect after damage calculation, its effect still activates.
- Even while "Skill Drain" is active, the "Thunder Option Token" cannot be Tributed for a Tribute Summon.

#### BONDING - H2O

- Tributing 2 “Hydrogeddon” and 1 “Oxygeddon” is a cost to activate “Bonding H2O”.  You can Tribute face-down monsters for this cost.
- You can use  “Bonding – H20” to Special Summon a “Water Dragon” from your Graveyard,  even if it was not properly Summoned previously.

#### BONE TEMPLE BLOCK

- Discarding a card is part of the resolution of “Bone Temple Block.”
- The effects of “Bone Temple Block” happen in sequence, so if you discard  “Archfiend of Gilfer,” it will miss the timing on and not activate its  effect.
- "Born Temple Block" targets the Monster Cards selected by each player.
- The turn player selects a monster first. If you activate “Bone Temple  Block” during your opponent’s turn, your opponent selects first.

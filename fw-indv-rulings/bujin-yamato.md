#### Bujin Yamato

-   If "Effect Veiler" was used on "Bujin Yamato" it is able to successfully activate and resolve it's effect in the End Phase. This is because the effect of "Bujin Yamato" is optional. The turn player can choose to wait  to activate the effect of "Bujin Yamato" until the non-turn player resolves the mandatory effect of "Effect Veiler". See the below bullet points for a detailed breakdown of the process in the End Phase:
    -  The turn player’s Yamato is still being negated by Veiler, so they will pass.
    -  The non-turn player wishes to continue Veiler’s effect, so they will pass.
    -  The turn player has no mandatory effects, so they must pass.
    -  The non-turn player MUST end Veiler’s effect because it is mandatory.
    -  The turn player now chooses to use Yamato’s effect because Veiler has ended. 

-   If "Thunder King Rai-Oh" is on the field, the effect of "Bujin Yamato" cannot be activated during the End Phase. Also, if during the resolution of the effect of "Bujin Yamato" during the End Phase "Thunder King Rai-Oh" is on the field, the effect of "Bujin Yamato" is not applied. (Since a card cannot be added from the Deck to the hand, sending a card from the hand to the Graveyard is not performed.)
-   Even if the effect of "Macro Cosmos" is being applied, the effect of "Bujin Yamato" can be activated during the End Phase. In that case, a "Bujin" monster is added from the Deck to the hand, and then since the effect of "Macro Cosmos" is being applied, the card that would be sent from the hand to the Graveyard is banished instead.
-   This effect does not target

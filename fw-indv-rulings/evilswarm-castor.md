#### Evilswarm Castor

-   If you Normal Summon "Evilswarm Castor" successfully, and their effects are not negated from the moment they step on to the field by something like Skill Drain, then for the rest of the turn their effect is applied, regardless of what happens to the monster (If a card like "Effect Veiler"/"Breakthrough Skill"/"Fiendish Chain" are used on "Evilswarm Castor" you are still able to perform the second summon)
-   The effect that performs an additional Normal Summon of an "lswarm" monster cannot be used to Set a monster in face-down Defense Position.
-   If this card is Normal Summoned while "Skill Drain" is active, the effect that performs an additional Normal Summon cannot be applied.
-   If "Skill Drain" is activated after this card is Normal Summoned, the effect that performs an additional Normal Summon can be applied.
